# Setup Mode – Design & Preconditions

Setup Mode is the **architectural stance** of HCS.

It focuses on **what must be true before we start cooperating**, so that the system does not begin with hidden “cooperation debt.”

Where the Core Model defines what cooperation *requires*,  
Setup Mode asks:

> “Given this specific context and people,  
> **how do we make those requirements explicit and agreed** before work begins?”

Setup Mode is about **designing preconditions and expectations**, not about fixing existing problems.

## When Setup Mode Is Active

You are in Setup Mode when:

- A **new collaboration** is forming (project, initiative, partnership, team).  
- An existing collaboration is being **significantly redefined** (new scope, new leader, new vendor, major restructuring).  
- A previous collaboration was effectively **reset**, and you are consciously rebuilding.  
- People are asking questions like:
  - “Who is actually responsible for what?”  
  - “How will we decide and escalate?”  
  - “What does ‘success’ mean for each side?”  
  - “What is in and out of scope for this relationship?”

If the system already shows recurring friction, conflict, or fatigue, you are likely beyond pure Setup and closer to **Stabilization** or **Reset**.  
Setup Mode works best **before** problems accumulate.

## Core Objectives of Setup Mode

Setup Mode has three primary objectives:

1. **Establish Preconditions (Level 1)**  
   Make the foundational conditions of cooperation **explicit and shared**:
   - Why we are cooperating together (Common Purpose).  
   - How we depend on each other (Interdependence).  
   - How we will communicate (Communication).  
   - What trust will be based on (Trust).  
   - How we expect change and uncertainty to be handled (Change / Uncertainty).

2. **Define Core Cooperative Needs (Level 2) in This Context**  
   Translate abstract cooperative needs into **concrete agreements**:
   - What Shared Understanding looks like in practice.  
   - What Mutual Commitment means for each party.  
   - Which Feedback Loops we will rely on.  
   - How roles and responsibilities will be distributed.  
   - Where autonomy is desired and where constraints are necessary.

3. **Select an Initial Cooperation Shape**  
   Decide **where to encapsulate and where to integrate**:
   - Which work can be modularized with clear contracts and handoffs.  
   - Which work requires shared sense-making and joint decisions.  
   - How boundaries, decision rights, and interfaces will be defined.

The outcome of Setup Mode is a **shared cooperation design** – not just a scope statement or project plan.

## Core Model Focus in Setup Mode

Setup Mode works mainly on **Levels 1 and 2** of the Pyramid, with a light touch on Level 3:

- **Level 1 – Preconditions for Cooperation**  
  - Clarifying purpose for all parties.  
  - Making interdependence visible, not assumed.  
  - Choosing communication channels and rhythms.  
  - Stating the basis of trust (what we will rely on each other for).  
  - Agreeing how change will be handled, not just how to proceed if all goes well.

- **Level 2 – Core Human Needs for Cooperative Work**  
  - Agreeing what “enough Shared Understanding” means before starting.  
  - Making Mutual Commitment explicit and reciprocal.  
  - Defining Feedback Loops early (what we will measure, how we will talk about it).  
  - Outlining Distribution of Roles and how this will evolve.  
  - Naming where Autonomy & Agency are required and where they are constrained.

- **Level 3 – Cooperative System Functions** (lightly)  
  Setup Mode does not fully design all functions, but it should:
  - Decide how **Problem Discovery** will happen (who frames the problem and how often).  
  - Sketch how **Planning & Prioritization** will be shared between parties.  
  - Agree on basic **Monitoring & Feedback** mechanisms (rhythms, data, conversations).

Setup Mode respects the **Level Rule** by **not jumping directly to practices** at Level 4.  
Method choices and tools can be deferred until the foundations are clear.

## Extended Dynamics in Setup Mode

Setup Mode is also the moment when **Extended Conditions and Extended Needs** can be addressed before they become invisible “politics” later.

Common **Extended Conditions** to consider:

- **Contextual:**  
  - What constraints, risks, or pressures are already shaping this cooperation?  
  - What is the wider organizational or market context?

- **Relational:**  
  - What prior history exists between the people or organizations involved?  
  - Are there existing alliances, expectations, or unresolved tensions?

- **Structural:**  
  - Where are the natural gatekeepers (access, decisions, resources)?  
  - How will other teams or departments indirectly affect this cooperation?

- **Developmental:**  
  - Is this a first-time collaboration or a repeated pattern?  
  - What has been learned from similar past efforts?

Common **Extended Needs** to surface:

- **Purpose & Direction:**  
  - What does “success” look like for each side?  
  - What hidden objectives (career, strategy, reputation) might be present?

- **Trust & Safety:**  
  - What would make this cooperation feel safe or unsafe?  
  - How will we raise concerns without causing unnecessary escalation?

- **Autonomy & Coherence:**  
  - Where does each side need freedom, and where do we need tight alignment?  
  - How do local choices remain coherent with the overall purpose?

Setup Mode is the best time to **name these topics explicitly**, before they crystallize into unspoken assumptions.

## What to Prioritize in Setup Mode

In Setup Mode, prioritize:

- **Clarity over speed**  
  Spend effort on shared understanding of purpose, constraints, and expectations.

- **Integration where it matters**  
  Decide which parts of the work require shared sense-making, not just handoffs.

- **Realistic commitments**  
  Make commitments that reflect constraints, risks, and interdependence, not idealized plans.

- **Explicit boundaries**  
  Define who decides what, where the edges of responsibility are, and how to handle overlap.

- **Early feedback channels**  
  Commit to how you will detect misalignment or emerging friction and how you will respond.

## What to Avoid in Setup Mode

Avoid:

- **Rushing to practices and tools (Level 4)**  
  Selecting frameworks, ceremonies, or tooling before foundations are clear.

- **Assuming alignment on purpose**  
  Treating a shared project label or contract as proof of shared meaning.

- **Ignoring extended dynamics**  
  Pretending politics, history, or power asymmetries do not exist.

- **Over-encapsulation**  
  Designing everything as a clean interface when some areas clearly require integration.

- **Over-promising and back-loading risk**  
  Agreeing to outcomes and timelines that depend on assumptions you have not tested or discussed.

## Mode Transitions

Typical transitions **into** Setup Mode:

- New initiative, engagement, or partnership.  
- Major change in scope, leadership, or environment that makes the old design obsolete.  
- Entering Reset Mode and deciding to rebuild.

Typical transitions **out of** Setup Mode:

- Into **Stabilization Mode**, once work starts and real-world friction appears.  
- Into **Growth Mode**, if early cooperation is smooth and foundations prove robust.

Unhealthy patterns:

- Skipping Setup Mode entirely and jumping straight into execution.  
- Treating Setup as a one-time ceremony instead of something that can be revisited when context or assumptions change.

## Summary

Setup Mode gives cooperation a **deliberate starting shape**.  
It does not guarantee the absence of problems, but it ensures that:

- when problems appear,  
- they appear **against a clear, shared baseline**  
- rather than inside a fog of unspoken expectations.
