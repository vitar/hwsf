# Reset Mode – Existential Re-Evaluation

Reset Mode is the **renovator stance** of HCS.

Where Stabilization Mode repairs, Growth Mode extends, and Conflict Mode makes tension visible, Reset Mode asks:

> “Given what has changed and what we’ve learned,  
> **does this cooperation system still make sense in its current form – and if not, what needs to end or be rebuilt?**”

It focuses on **acknowledging that the old contract is no longer valid** and **designing the conditions for a different future** – whether together or apart.

Reset Mode is not an admission of failure.  
It is a recognition that **context, purpose, or legitimacy have moved on**, and the system must either transform or be consciously closed.

## When Reset Mode Is Active

You are in Reset Mode when:

- The **original basis of cooperation has fundamentally changed**:
  - Strategy, market, or funding shifts make previous goals obsolete.  
  - Key stakeholders, sponsors, or decision-makers have changed.  
  - The intended value is no longer relevant or worth the cost.

- Or, the **relationship itself is no longer workable**:
  - Repeated Stabilization and Conflict efforts have not led to sustainable improvement.  
  - Parties remain technically cooperative but are emotionally or politically disengaged.  
  - People privately agree: “If we were starting today, we wouldn’t design it like this.”

Typical entry signals:

- Long-running projects or partnerships that feel “too big to stop” but no longer make sense.  
- Initiatives continued out of habit, sunk cost, or fear of political consequences.  
- A sense of **stagnation, cynicism, or quiet exit** (people leaving, disengaging, or “ghosting” the work).

If the core purpose is still valid and trust is repairable, you may be in **Stabilization** or **Conflict** rather than Reset.  
Reset Mode is appropriate when **continuing “as is” is the more dangerous option**.

## Core Objectives of Reset Mode

Reset Mode has three main objectives:

1. **Face Reality About the Current System**
   - Name clearly:
     - what has changed in context and purpose,  
     - what is no longer true or legitimate,  
     - what damage or fatigue has accumulated.
   - Stop pretending the old system is still appropriate.

2. **Decide What Ends, What Continues, and What Transforms**
   - Clarify:
     - which agreements, roles, and structures should be **ended**,  
     - which parts still have value and can be **preserved**,  
     - what needs to be **redesigned from first principles**.
   - Avoid “zombie cooperation” – arrangements that exist on paper but not in reality.

3. **Create Conditions for a Clean Start (or Clean Closure)**
   - If cooperation should continue in a different form:
     - define a clear path back to **Setup Mode**.  
   - If cooperation should end:
     - close it with clarity and respect, avoiding unnecessary harm and ambiguity.

Reset Mode is about **integrity**: aligning the cooperation system with what is actually true now.

## Core Model Focus in Reset Mode

Reset Mode primarily revisits **Level 1 and Level 2** of the Pyramid, with deliberate decisions about what happens to Levels 3–5.

- **Level 1 – Preconditions for Cooperation**
  - The central questions:
    - Is there still a **shared, legitimate purpose** for this cooperation?  
    - Is the **interdependence** still real, or has it become forced or symbolic?  
    - Can we still meaningfully **communicate** as partners?  
    - Is there enough **trust** to justify continued cooperation?  
    - Has the **change/uncertainty landscape** shifted so much that old assumptions are invalid?

  If the answer to these is mostly “no”, remaining in the existing system is often worse than resetting.

- **Level 2 – Core Human Needs for Cooperative Work**
  - In Reset Mode, you examine:
    - whether Shared Understanding is possible or constantly dissolves,  
    - whether Mutual Commitment is genuinely reciprocal or deeply unbalanced,  
    - whether Feedback Loops are functional or systematically ignored,  
    - whether Distribution of Roles remains legitimate,  
    - whether any real Autonomy & Agency is left on both sides.

- **Levels 3–5 – Functions, Practices, Meta-Practices**
  - Reset Mode does **not** try to optimize these.  
  - It asks which functions and practices:
    - should be **retired** with the system,  
    - can be **salvaged** and reused elsewhere,  
    - reveal insights that should inform future Setup and Stabilization.

The **Level Rule** is invoked here in its strongest form:  
if Level 1 is fundamentally broken, working harder on Levels 3–4 is a way of avoiding reality.

## Extended Dynamics in Reset Mode

Reset Mode operates in a landscape of **strong Extended Conditions and Extended Needs**, often accumulated over time.

Typical **Extended Conditions**:

- **Contextual**
  - Market shifts, mergers, reorganizations, funding cuts, regulatory changes.  
  - New strategic priorities that make the old cooperation peripheral or obstructive.

- **Relational**
  - History of unresolved conflicts, broken commitments, or repeated disappointments.  
  - Loss of goodwill, even if people remain “professional”.

- **Structural**
  - Power shifts: who can exit, who is locked in, who decides to end or renew the contract.  
  - Misaligned incentives that reward continuation even when it makes no sense.

- **Developmental**
  - The system has reached the end of a natural lifecycle.  
  - Attempts to “revive” it feel more like resuscitating something that wants to end.

Typical **Extended Needs** in focus:

- **Purpose & Direction**
  - People need clarity about **why** any continuation or termination is happening.  
  - They need to see that decisions match stated values.

- **Trust & Safety**
  - People want to know they will not be punished for acknowledging reality.  
  - They need assurances about how changes will affect them.

- **Recognition & Belonging**
  - There is a need to honor contributions and effort, even if the outcome is closure.  
  - Individuals and teams may fear loss of identity or status tied to the existing system.

Reset Mode treats these needs as **central**, not peripheral, to ending or transforming cooperation responsibly.

## What to Prioritize in Reset Mode

Prioritize:

- **Telling the truth about viability**
  - Clearly state when the existing cooperation no longer serves its intended purpose.  
  - Share assessments and constraints transparently with key stakeholders.

- **Honoring what has been invested**
  - Acknowledge the work, learning, and relationships built.  
  - Distinguish between **failed outcomes** and **valuable efforts**.

- **Designing a deliberate ending or restart**
  - Define:
    - what exactly stops and when,  
    - what transitions to a different form,  
    - what must be kept running temporarily to avoid harm.

- **Protecting people during transition**
  - Consider psychological and political impact:
    - How will people be informed?  
    - Who might feel blamed or abandoned?  
    - How can you avoid unnecessary stigma or shame?

- **Capturing learning for future Setup and Stabilization**
  - Document key insights:
    - what worked,  
    - what failed,  
    - what assumptions proved wrong.  
  - Feed this back into **Setup Mode** for any new cooperation that follows.

## What to Avoid in Reset Mode

Avoid:

- **Silent decay**
  - Letting the system die informally without explicit decisions, leaving people confused and stuck in limbo.

- **Sunk-cost insistence**
  - Continuing cooperation purely because “we’ve already invested so much”.

- **Cosmetic rebranding**
  - Renaming or relabeling the system without changing purpose, structure, or relationships.

- **Scapegoating**
  - Blaming individuals or one party for a situation driven by context shifts or joint design choices.

- **Rushing into a new Setup without integration**
  - Jumping straight into a new cooperation design without integrating what the old one taught you.

Reset Mode is about **clean decisions**, not cosmetic change.

## Mode Transitions

Typical transitions **into** Reset Mode:

- From **Growth Mode**, when expansion runs into strategic or contextual walls that cannot be worked around.  
- From **Conflict Mode**, when attempts at repair reveal that continued cooperation would be harmful or pointless.  
- From **Stabilization Mode**, when repeated attempts to stabilize fail because the underlying purpose or context has fundamentally shifted.

Typical transitions **out of** Reset Mode:

- Into **Setup Mode**, when a new or radically redesigned cooperation is justified.  
- Into **no cooperation**, when the best option is to stop working together in this domain.  
- Into **limited, re-scoped cooperation**, with much narrower boundaries and expectations.

Unhealthy patterns:

- Treating Reset as a purely technical or contractual event, ignoring emotional and relational impact.  
- Cycling between Growth and Stabilization to avoid acknowledging the need for Reset.  
- Treating Reset as a “failure to hide”, instead of a necessary adaptation to reality.

## Summary

Reset Mode allows a cooperation system to **end or transform with integrity**.

It does not guarantee that everyone will be happy with the outcome.  
Its role is to ensure that:

- the decision to continue, transform, or end cooperation is based on **current reality**, not past intent,  
- foundational conditions (purpose, interdependence, trust) are not faked or assumed,  
- people are **not trapped** in obsolete or harmful arrangements out of habit or fear,  
- valuable learning and relationships are **carried forward consciously**,  
- any new cooperation starts from **Setup Mode**, not from the unspoken debris of the old system.

Used well, Reset Mode prevents organizations and teams from living in “zombie cooperation” –  
freeing energy and attention for systems that are genuinely alive, needed, and possible.
