# System Modes – Introduction & Purpose

Cooperation is not static.  
The same team can experience clear alignment one month, escalating tension the next, and the need for a full reset a year later.

The **Core Model** of HCS describes what cooperation requires.  
The **Extended Human Dynamics** section describes what cooperation must navigate.

The **System Modes** section describes **how to act on this system over time**.

System Modes define distinct **operational stances** for working with cooperation:

- how we design it  
- how we stabilize it  
- how we grow it  
- how we handle conflict  
- how we reset it when the context has fundamentally changed

They turn HCS from a static model into a **longitudinal operating system**.

## Why System Modes Exist

Even with a clear Matrix and Pyramid, practitioners still face a practical question:

> “Given the state of this team or relationship **right now**,  
> what kind of intervention makes sense, and what should we avoid?”

Without a mode-based lens, organizations tend to:

- optimize practices (Level 4) when foundations (Levels 1–2) are unstable  
- avoid conflict until it becomes destructive  
- try to “grow” a system that is still in basic stabilization  
- continue operating under a contract that is effectively obsolete

System Modes provide **named patterns** for these situations.  
They ensure that actions respect:

- the **dependency order** of the Pyramid (Level Rule), and  
- the difference between **structural** and **human** dynamics.

## What a Mode Is (and Is Not)

A **System Mode** is:

- a **dominant systemic activity** required for stability at a given moment,  
- a lens for choosing **what to prioritize** and **what to postpone**,  
- a way to coordinate multiple roles around the **same intent** for intervention.

A mode is **not**:

- a maturity level (teams can move between modes non-linearly),  
- a lifecycle phase with fixed duration (modes can recur or overlap),  
- a personality label for teams (“we are a Growth Mode team”).

Modes describe **what the cooperation system needs from us now**, not who we are.

## The Five System Modes at a Glance

HCS defines five primary modes:

### Setup Mode – Design & Preconditions

- **Core question:** *“What must be true before we start?”*  
- **Focus:** Establishing preconditions (Level 1) and core cooperative needs (Level 2).  
- **Typical use:** New engagements, major re-charters, post-reset rebuilds.  
- **Risk if skipped:** The system starts with “cooperation debt” – unstable by design.

### Stabilization Mode – Repair & Calibration

- **Core question:** *“Where is cooperation failing, and how do we restore basic stability?”*  
- **Focus:** Identifying the **lowest unstable level** and repairing core functions (Level 3) and their prerequisites.  
- **Typical use:** Early friction, recurring breakdowns, chronic misalignment, low trust.  
- **Risk if skipped:** Teams normalize dysfunction and escalate problems upward instead of fixing them.

### Growth Mode – Optimization & Extension

- **Core question:** *“How do we increase autonomy, speed, and learning without losing coherence?”*  
- **Focus:** Strengthening and extending existing functions; expanding boundaries safely.  
- **Typical use:** Stable teams aiming for higher performance, resilience, or scope.  
- **Risk if misapplied:** Adding complexity to a system that is not yet stable.

### Conflict Mode – Safety & Realignment

- **Core question:** *“How do we address tension and conflict without causing further harm?”*  
- **Focus:** Restoring psychological safety, re-aligning expectations, repairing relationships and trust.  
- **Typical use:** Escalated tensions, repeated personal conflicts, breakdowns in trust or legitimacy.  
- **Risk if avoided:** Hidden conflict shifts into sabotage, disengagement, or forced exits.

### Reset Mode – Existential Re-Evaluation

- **Core question:** *“Given what has changed, does the existing cooperation system still make sense?”*  
- **Focus:** Acknowledging that previous assumptions, contracts, or structures are no longer valid.  
- **Typical use:** Strategy shifts, major organizational change, funding or market shocks, long-term accumulated damage.  
- **Risk if postponed:** Everyone continues to operate inside a contract that no longer exists in reality.

## How Modes Relate to the Core and Extended Models

System Modes operate **under** the constraints of the Core Model and Extended Human Dynamics:

- The **Matrix** and **Pyramid** define what must be true and in what order.  
- **Extended Conditions** and **Extended Needs** explain why cooperation feels the way it does.  
- **System Modes** decide **where to focus attention now** and **what kind of work** is appropriate.

Modes do not change the underlying “physics” of cooperation.  
They decide how to work with those physics **given the current state** of the system.

## How to Use This Section

1. **Identify the current dominant need.**  
   Are you setting up, stabilizing, growing, handling conflict, or facing a potential reset?

2. **Switch explicitly into that mode.**  
   Align key participants on *which mode you are in* and *what that implies* for priorities.

3. **Use the Core Model as your map.**  
   Within each mode, reason about levels and functions using the Matrix and Pyramid.

4. **Use Extended Human Dynamics to understand resistance and distortion.**  
   Where structure seems correct but cooperation feels wrong, look at Extended Conditions and Needs.

5. **Use the Diagnostics section as a shared navigation pattern.**  
   The **Diagnostics** section (starting with the [Integration Guide](../400-diagnostics/400-integration-guide.md)) describes how to combine Core Model, Extended Dynamics, and System Modes into a coherent diagnostic and intervention flow.

Subsequent chapters describe each mode in more detail.  
They do not define new theory; they explain **how to apply the Human Cooperation System** when the work requires design, stabilization, growth, conflict handling, or reset.
