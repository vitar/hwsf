## Why the Level Rule Exists

The **Level Rule** is the single most practical principle of the Human Cooperation System.<br/>
It prevents teams and leaders from treating symptoms at the *wrong level* — such as changing practices when the underlying conditions or needs are unstable.

In cooperation systems, **every level depends on the stability of the one below it**.<br/>
Just as a house can’t rest on a weak foundation, teams can’t sustain new practices if trust, clarity, or purpose are missing.<br/>
The Level Rule helps you locate *where to intervene first* when diagnosing or improving collaboration.

> The deeper the dysfunction, the lower the level you must repair.

## How to Apply the Level Rule

When you observe friction, confusion, or performance drops, follow this diagnostic sequence before deciding what to change:

1. **Start from the bottom.**<br/>
   Check that foundational *conditions for cooperation* (Level 1) are present — shared purpose, trust, interdependence, and communication.

2. **Assess human needs.**<br/>
   Verify that *day-to-day enablers* (Level 2) are satisfied — shared understanding, mutual commitment, feedback loops, role clarity, and agency.

3. **Evaluate system functions.**<br/>
   Review whether *core cooperation functions* (Level 3) are active — such as planning, feedback, enablement, and adaptation.

4. **Then adjust practices.**<br/>
   Only once the system is stable below Level 3 should you change *practices or frameworks* (Level 4).

5. **Reflect and evolve.**<br/>
   At maturity (Level 5), teams begin to *self-diagnose and adapt* — applying the Level Rule themselves.

## The Five Levels at a Glance

1. **Level 1 – Preconditions for Cooperation**<br/>
   *Common Purpose, Interdependence, Communication, Trust, Change/Uncertainty tolerance*
   Must exist for cooperation to even begin. Without these, no system of collaboration can sustain.

2. **Level 2 – Core Human Needs**<br/>
   *Shared Understanding, Mutual Commitment, Feedback Loops, Distribution of Roles, Autonomy & Agency*<br/>
   These needs must be met for day-to-day work to flow without friction.

3. **Level 3 – Cooperative Functions**<br/>
   The *25 functions from the [Matrix](110-matrix.md)* must be minimally expressed so the system can coordinate, learn, and adapt.

4. **Level 4 – Practices & Frameworks**<br/>
   Only after stabilizing Levels 1–3 can practices be tuned, replaced, or scaled without “fighting gravity.”

5. **Level 5 – Meta-Practices & Innovation**<br/>
   Once the system is stable and self-aware, it can safely evolve its own way of working.

## Diagnostic Heuristics

Use these quick rules when assessing where to act:

- If a problem **repeats across multiple practices**, it’s likely **not** a Level 4 issue — check Levels 1–3.
- If alignment **collapses under stress**, the root cause is almost always at **Level 1 or 2**.
- If coordination **stalls despite good relationships**, inspect **Level 3** — one or more core functions are missing or unclear.
- If **people lose trust in frameworks**, it may signal a mismatch between the *function needed* and the *practice chosen* (Level 4 problem built on weak lower layers).

## Common Anti-Patterns

- **Cargo culting** – copying visible practices (Level 4) to compensate for missing foundations (Level 1–2).
- **Premature scaling** – optimizing or standardizing before core functions are stable.
- **Overdiagnosis** – jumping to structural fixes instead of addressing unmet human needs.
- **Tool worship** – assuming the adoption of a tool solves cooperation gaps.

## Practical Example

When a team repeatedly fails to deliver despite switching from Scrum to Kanban:

- Level 4 (Practices) changes are visible but ineffective.
- Diagnosis shows missing **Feedback Loops** and unclear **Distribution of Roles** → both are *Level 2 needs*.
- Root cause lies lower — no amount of framework tuning will fix it until **shared understanding and feedback culture** are restored.

> The Level Rule turns “what framework should we use?” into “what layer of cooperation is failing right now?”

## Summary

The **Level Rule** ensures interventions follow the natural order of cooperation:

| If you want to fix... | First verify... | Otherwise you risk... |
|------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Practices or tools | Preconditions and needs | Surface fixes without stability |
| Collaboration quality | Trust, commitment, and understanding | Repeating breakdowns |
| Delivery flow | Functional coordination | Hidden friction and rework |
| Team autonomy | Clear roles and feedback | Chaos disguised as freedom |

### Essence of the Rule

> Never try to optimize the system at a higher level than it can currently sustain.

Mastering this principle makes every improvement effort more efficient, humane, and lasting.
