# The Level Rule

Before changing *practices* (Level 4), verify and stabilize lower levels:

1. **Level 1 – Preconditions** (Common Purpose, Interdependence, Communication, Trust, Change/Uncertainty tolerance) must be present enough for collaboration to exist at all.
2. **Level 2 – Human Needs** (Shared Understanding, Mutual Commitment, Feedback Loops, Distribution of Roles, Autonomy & Agency) must be sufficiently met for day-to-day work to function.
3. **Level 3 – Work Functions** (the 25 cells) must be minimally expressed so the system can coordinate and learn.
4. **Level 4 – Practices** can then be tuned or replaced without fighting gravity.
5. **Level 5 – Meta-Practices** emerge once the system can safely adapt itself.

**Heuristic**

- If a problem repeats across different practices, it’s likely **not** a Level 4 issue.
- If alignment collapses under stress, check **Level 1–2**.
- If coordination stalls but relationships seem sound, inspect **Level 3** (*which function is missing?*).

**Anti-pattern**: cargo-culting practices at Level 4 to compensate for missing Level 1–2 foundations.
