# The Human Cooperation System Pyramid

!!! warning "DRAFT VERSION"
    This document is a **working draft** of the *Human Cooperation System (HCS)*.<br/>
    Content, terminology, and structure are **subject to revision**.

## Why the Pyramid Exists

The **HCS Pyramid** visualizes how cooperation evolves through **five systemic levels** — from the most fundamental conditions of existence to reflective innovation at the top.<br/>
It helps identify *where cooperation breaks down* and *which level to address first* when diagnosing teams, organizations, or partnerships.

The Pyramid complements the [HCS Matrix](110-matrix.md):

- The **Matrix** defines *what must coexist* (conditions × needs).
- The **Pyramid** shows *how these elements build on one another* — a hierarchy of dependency where higher levels depend on the stability of lower ones.

In short:
> The Matrix describes **the anatomy of cooperation**,<br/>
> while the Pyramid shows **its order of development**.

## How to Use the Pyramid

Use the Pyramid as a **diagnostic guide**:

1. Identify which level the issue originates from — conditions, needs, functions, practices, or reflection.
2. Avoid “patching” higher levels (e.g., practices or frameworks) when foundational levels are weak.
3. Move upward only when stability and coherence are achieved below.

Each level in the Pyramid corresponds to a layer of the Human Cooperation System — from the first moment people start working together to when they consciously evolve how they work.

## Level 1 – Preconditions for Cooperation (Foundation)

Without these, there’s no “working together” at all.<br/>
They’re the *existential conditions* of cooperation — the soil from which all other levels grow.

Examples:

- **Existence of a Common Purpose** – shared “why” to engage at all.
- **Interdependence** – mutual reliance or need for others’ contributions.
- **Basic Communication ability** – shared medium: language, symbols, signals.
- **Basic Trust** – belief that others will not harm and will reciprocate.
- **Capacity to Act under Change** – some tolerance for uncertainty.

*Maslow analogy*: Physiological & safety needs — the “oxygen” of cooperation.

## Level 2 – Core Human Needs for Cooperative Work

These are the *human-level enablers* that make foundational conditions workable day-to-day.<br/>
This corresponds to the **horizontal axis** in the [Matrix](110-matrix.md).

Examples:

- **Shared Understanding** — common mental model of goals, constraints, and context.
- **Mutual Commitment** — agreement to invest effort in the shared purpose.
- **Feedback Loops** — ability to observe, learn, and adjust.
- **Distribution of Roles** — clarity on who does what.
- **Autonomy & Agency** — freedom and authority to act.

*Maslow analogy*: Belonging and esteem needs — creating security in relationships and a sense of contribution.

## Level 3 – Cooperative System Functions

Stable **functions** that translate human needs into **coordinated, repeatable work**.<br/>
These live in the 25 [Matrix](110-matrix.md) cells and define what must happen for collaboration to succeed.

Examples:

- **Problem Discovery** (Clarity of Problem Space × Shared Understanding)
- **Planning & Prioritization** (Interdependence × Distribution of Roles)
- **Monitoring & Feedback** (Communication × Feedback Loops)
- **Enablement & Empowerment** (Trust × Autonomy & Agency)
- **Adaptation & Learning** (Change × Feedback Loops)

These are the “work muscles” — when one is weak, the whole system compensates or breaks.
*Maslow analogy*: Cognitive needs — organizing and directing effort.

## Level 4 – Practices & Frameworks

Concrete, evolving ways of performing the functions.<br/>
Different implementations can fulfill the same function, depending on the organization’s context.

Examples:

- **Retrospectives** fulfill *Monitoring & Feedback*.
- **RACI matrix** fulfills *Distribution of Roles*.
- **Scrum sprint planning** fulfills *Planning & Prioritization*.
- **JTBD interviews** fulfill *Problem Discovery*.
- **Kanban** fulfills *Flow & Focus + Monitoring & Feedback*.

This is where change happens fastest — tools and trends evolve, but underlying functions stay stable.<br/>
*Maslow analogy*: Self-actualization tools — many possible routes to fulfill the same higher need.

## Level 5 – Meta-Practices & Innovation (Apex)

The ability to **reflect on and redesign the system itself**.<br/>
Here, teams stop merely applying practices and begin **adapting or inventing** them to fit their unique context.

Includes:

- Combining practices into custom playbooks.
- Inventing new practices when existing ones don’t fit.
- Matching practices consciously to functions (avoiding “cargo cult” behavior).
- Teaching and sharing system-level understanding.

*Maslow analogy*: Self-transcendence — going beyond individual optimization to improve the system for others.

## Pyramid View – Start & Top

!!! tip "Always climb levels in order"
    Don’t patch Level 4 **practices** when Level 1–2 **preconditions or human needs** are weak.<br/>
    Fix lower levels first — then revisit practices.

- **It starts** at Level 1 the moment two or more people have a reason to interact for mutual value.
- **It tops** at Level 5 when teams become self-evolving systems — capable of diagnosing, designing, and improving their own way of working without external imposition.

| Level | Name | Examples | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **5 (Apex)** | Meta-Practices & Innovation | <ul><li>Designing custom playbooks</li><li>Inventing new practices</li><li>Matching practices to functions deliberately</li><li>Coaching others in system thinking</li></ul> | Teams consciously reflect on, adapt, and redesign their way of working. Practices are tailored, combined, or invented to better serve needs. Knowledge is shared to elevate the whole system. |
| **4** | Practices & Frameworks | <ul><li>Retrospectives (*Monitoring & Feedback*)</li><li>RACI matrix (*Distribution of Roles*)</li><li>Scrum sprint planning (*Planning & Prioritization*)</li><li>JTBD interviews (*Problem Discovery*)</li><li>Kanban (*Flow & Focus + Monitoring & Feedback*)</li></ul> | Specific, evolving methods that fulfill stable functions. Practices change over time, but the function they serve remains stable. |
| **3** | Cooperative System Functions | <ul><li>Problem Discovery (*Clarity of Problem Space × Shared Understanding*)</li><li>Planning & Prioritization (*Interdependence × Distribution of Roles*)</li><li>Monitoring & Feedback (*Communication × Feedback Loops*)</li><li>Enablement & Empowerment (*Trust × Autonomy & Agency*)</li><li>Adaptation & Learning (*Change × Feedback Loops*)</li></ul> | The stable “muscles” of cooperation — what must happen for work to succeed. Represented by the 25 cells in the [Human Cooperation System Matrix](110-matrix.md). |
| **2** | Core Human Needs for Cooperative Work | <ul><li>Shared Understanding</li><li>Mutual Commitment</li><li>Feedback Loops</li><li>Distribution of Roles</li><li>Autonomy & Agency</li></ul> | The human-level enablers that make foundational conditions operational. Corresponds to the [Matrix’s](110-matrix.md) **horizontal axis**. |
| **1 (Foundation)** | Preconditions for Cooperation | <ul><li>Common Purpose</li><li>Interdependence</li><li>Communication</li><li>Trust</li><li>Change/Uncertainty tolerance</li></ul> | The existential conditions for cooperation to exist at all. Corresponds to the [Matrix’s](110-matrix.md) **vertical axis**. Without these, there is no “working together.” |

## Diagnostic Use

When diagnosing cooperation:

- Weakness in **Level 1 or 2** indicates instability in the foundations — people lack shared context or trust.
- Weakness in **Level 3** suggests missing or broken system functions.
- Weakness in **Level 4** means inappropriate or outdated practices are being applied.
- Weakness in **Level 5** shows that the system can’t yet learn or evolve on its own.

The Pyramid helps shift conversations from *“What framework should we use?”* to *“Which layer of cooperation needs attention first?”*
