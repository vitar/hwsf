# The Human Work System Pyramid

- **Bottom** = prerequisites for any work between humans to even exist.
- **Middle** = stable functions that turn those prerequisites into coordinated effort.
- **Top** = practices, frameworks, and optimizations that refine or expand what’s possible.

## Level 1 – Preconditions for Collaboration (Foundation)

Without these, there’s no “working together” at all.<br/>
They’re the *existential conditions* of collaboration.

Examples:

- **Existence of a Common Purpose** (shared “why” to engage at all)
- **Interdependence** (need for something from others, mutual or one-way)
- **Basic Communication ability** (shared medium: language, symbols, signals)
- **Basic Trust** (belief others are not harmful / will reciprocate)
- **Capacity to Act under Change** (some tolerance to uncertainty)

*Maslow analogy*: Physiological & safety needs — the “oxygen” of collaboration.

## Level 2 – Core Human Needs for Collaborative Work

These are the *human-level enablers* that make foundational conditions workable day-to-day.<br/>
This is essentially **Horizontal Axis** in the [Matrix](110-matrix.md).

Examples:

- **Shared Understanding** — same mental model of goals, constraints, and context.
- **Mutual Commitment** — agreement to invest effort in the shared purpose.
- **Feedback Loops** — ability to observe, learn, and adjust.
- **Distribution of Roles** — clarity on who does what.
- **Autonomy & Agency** — freedom and authority to act.

*Maslow analogy*: Belonging and esteem needs — creating security in relationships and a place for contribution.

## Level 3 – Work System Functions

Stable **functions** that translate human needs into **coordinated, repeatable work**.<br/>
These live in the 25 [matrix](110-matrix.md) cells and define what must happen for collaboration to succeed.

Examples:

- **Problem Discovery** (Clarity of Problem Space × Shared Understanding)
- **Planning & Prioritization** (Interdependence × Distribution of Roles)
- **Monitoring & Feedback** (Communication × Feedback Loops)
- **Enablement & Empowerment** (Trust × Autonomy & Agency)
- **Adaptation & Learning** (Change × Feedback Loops)

These are the “work muscles” — when one is weak, the whole system compensates or breaks.<br/>
*Maslow analogy*: Cognitive needs — organizing and directing effort.

## Level 4 – Practices & Frameworks

Concrete ways of performing functions, evolving over time.</br>
Different implementations can fulfill the same function.

Examples:

- **Retrospectives** fulfill *Monitoring & Feedback*.
- **RACI matrix** fulfills *Distribution of Roles*.
- **Scrum sprint planning** fulfills *Planning & Prioritization*.
- **JTBD interviews** fulfill *Problem Discovery*.
- **Kanban** fulfills *Flow & Focus + Monitoring & Feedback*.

Here is where change is fastest — new tools, trends, and methods appear, but the underlying function remains the same.<br/>
*Maslow analogy*: Self-actualization tools — many possible routes to fulfill the same higher need.

## Level 5 – Meta-Practices & Innovation (Apex)

Ability to **reflect on the system itself** and redesign it intentionally.<br/>
This is when teams stop just applying practices and start adapting or inventing them to better fit their needs.

Includes:

- Combining practices into custom playbooks.
- Inventing new practices when existing ones don’t fit.
- Continually matching practices to functions consciously (avoiding “cargo cult” use).
- Sharing and teaching system-level thinking to others.

*Maslow analogy*: Self-transcendence — going beyond individual optimization to improve the system for others.

## Pyramid view – Start & Top

!!! tip "Always climb levels in order"
    Don’t patch Level 4 **practices** when Level 1–2 **preconditions or human needs** are weak. Fix lower levels first—then revisit practices.

- **It starts** at Level 1 the moment two or more people have a reason to interact for mutual value.
- **It tops** at Level 5 when teams become self-evolving systems, capable of diagnosing, designing, and improving their own way of working without external imposition.

| Level | Name | Examples | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **5 (Apex)** | Meta-Practices & Innovation | <ul><li>Designing custom playbooks</li><li>Inventing new practices</li><li>Matching practices to functions deliberately</li><li>Coaching others in system thinking</li></ul> | Teams consciously reflect on, adapt, and redesign their way of working. Practices are tailored, combined, or invented to better serve needs. Knowledge is shared to elevate the whole system. |
| **4** | Practices & Frameworks | <ul><li>Retrospectives (*Monitoring & Feedback*)</li><li>RACI matrix (*Distribution of Roles*)</li><li>Scrum sprint planning (*Planning & Prioritization*)</li><li>JTBD interviews (*Problem Discovery*)</li><li>Kanban (*Flow & Focus + Monitoring & Feedback*)</li></ul> | Specific, evolving methods that fulfill stable functions. Practices change over time, but the function they serve remains stable. |
| **3** | Work System Functions | <ul><li>Problem Discovery (*Clarity of Problem Space × Shared Understanding*)</li><li>Planning & Prioritization (*Interdependence × Distribution of Roles*)</li><li>Monitoring & Feedback (*Communication × Feedback Loops*)</li><li>Enablement & Empowerment (*Trust × Autonomy & Agency*)</li><li>Adaptation & Learning (*Change × Feedback Loops*)</li></ul> | The stable “muscles” of collaboration — what must happen for work to succeed. Represented by the 25 cells in the [Human Work System Matrix](110-matrix.md). |
| **2** | Core Human Needs for Collaborative Work | <ul><li>Shared Understanding</li><li>Mutual Commitment</li><li>Feedback Loops</li><li>Distribution of Roles</li><li>Autonomy & Agency</li></ul> | The human-level enablers that make foundational conditions operational. Corresponds to the [Matrix’s](110-matrix.md) **horizontal axis.** |
| **1 (Foundation)** | Preconditions for Collaboration | <ul><li>Common Purpose</li><li>Interdependence</li><li>Communication</li><li>Trust</li><li>Change/Uncertainty tolerance</li></ul> | The existential conditions for collaboration to exist at all. Corresponds to the [Matrix’s](110-matrix.md) **vertical axis**. Without these, there is no “working together.” |

This structure makes it easy to trace a problem from the bottom up:

- Weakness in **Level 1 or 2** means the system lacks collaborative stability.
- Weakness in **Level 3** means a core function is missing or broken.
- Weakness in **Level 4** often means wrong or outdated practices are being applied.
- Weakness in **Level 5** means the system can’t evolve on its own.
