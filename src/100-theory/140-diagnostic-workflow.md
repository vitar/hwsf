# Diagnostic Workflow (Observation → Matrix → Level → Function → Practice)

!!! warning "DRAFT VERSION"
    This document is a **working draft** of the *Human Work System Framework (HWSF)*.<br/>
    Content, terminology, and structure are **subject to revision**.

Use this quick loop on any observed issue:

## 1. Observation (evidence)

- Write what you *saw/heard/measured* without judgment.
- Example: “Critical dependencies discovered late; downstream team blocked twice this sprint.”

## 2. Matrix Mapping (where it lives)

- Map the observation to the **Matrix axes**: which **Condition** (vertical) and which **Human Need** (horizontal)?
- Example: **Interdependence × Feedback Loops** → *Outcome reflection*.

## 3. Level Check (how deep the root is)

- Is this a missing **precondition** (Level 1), **human need** (Level 2), or **function** (Level 3)?
- Example: Repeated late discovery hints at weak **Level 3 Monitoring & Feedback** and possibly thin **Level 2 Feedback Loops**.

## 4. Function to Practice (what to change safely)

- Identify the **function** to strengthen (from the 25 cells), then choose or design a **practice** that fulfills it.
- Example: Strengthen *signal & response cadence* (Comm × Feedback). Practices: explicit dependency scan per PRD item; daily risk surfacing; lightweight Andon.

## 5. Trial & Learn (tight loop)

- Introduce the practice for 1–2 cycles, measure the specific signal, and **iterate**.
- If it fails, re-check **lower levels** before swapping practices.
