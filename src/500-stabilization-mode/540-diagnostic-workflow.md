# Diagnostic Workflow — Observation → Matrix → Level → Function → Practice

## Why the Diagnostic Workflow Exists

The **HCS Diagnostic Workflow** turns theory into action.<br/>
It provides a structured loop for tracing **observable issues** in cooperation back to their **systemic root causes** — before deciding how to intervene.

Most improvement efforts fail because they start with *practice changes* (Level 4) rather than diagnosing *which level of cooperation is weak*.<br/>
This workflow keeps analysis grounded and ensures each corrective action strengthens the right layer of the system.

> The goal is not to fix symptoms — it’s to restore coherence between **conditions, needs, and functions**.

## How the Workflow Works

Use this short, structured loop on any issue or pattern you observe.

### **1. Observation — Capture evidence**

Write down what you *see, hear, or measure* — without interpretation or blame.<br/>
Focus on **observable behavior**, not assumptions.

**Example:**
> “Critical dependencies were discovered late; downstream team blocked twice this sprint.”

This ensures that diagnosis starts from data, not opinion.

### **2. Matrix Mapping — Locate where it lives**

Map the observation to the **[HCS Matrix](../100-core-model/110-matrix.md)**:<br/>
Which **Condition** (vertical axis) and which **Human Need** (horizontal axis) are involved?
If the structural cell seems correct but the issue persists emotionally or politically, use the [**Extended Human Dynamics**](../200-extended-model/200-intro-purpose.md) section to examine contextual or relational distortions.

**Example:**
> **Interdependence × Feedback Loops → Outcome Reflection**<br/>
> Late discovery means coordination and feedback signals are weak.

This step anchors the issue to a specific **function** — preventing vague problem statements like “communication issue” or “poor planning.”

### **3. Level Check — Find how deep the root is**

Determine the **lowest affected level** in the [HCS Pyramid](../100-core-model/120-pyramid.md):

| If the problem is about… | It likely belongs to… |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| Missing purpose, trust, or communication basics | **Level 1 – Preconditions** |
| Misalignment, unclear roles, weak feedback, low agency | **Level 2 – Human Needs** |
| Broken coordination or learning cycles | **Level 3 – Functions** |
| Ineffective or misapplied methods | **Level 4 – Practices** |
| Lack of reflection or self-improvement | **Level 5 – Meta-Practices** |

**Example:**
> Repeated late dependency discovery → weak **Level 3 Monitoring & Feedback**<br/>
> Possibly thin **Level 2 Feedback Loops** underneath.

This step is where the **Level Rule** applies — fix lower levels first.

### **4. Function to Practice — Select what to strengthen**

Once you’ve located the function, choose or design a **practice** that fulfills it.

Use the 25 [Matrix functions](../100-core-model/110-matrix.md) as your reference for what “healthy cooperation” looks like.<br/>
The practice can be a known method or a custom one suited to your context.

**Example:**
> Function: *Communication × Feedback Loops → Signal & Response*<br/>
> Practice ideas:<br/>
> - Add an explicit dependency scan before each sprint.
> - Introduce a daily “risk surfacing” moment.
> - Create a visual “Andon” signal for cross-team blockers.

### **5. Trial & Learn — Validate and iterate**

Run the chosen practice for 1–2 cycles and track a **specific observable signal** (not vague satisfaction scores).<br/>
If it doesn’t produce the expected outcome, recheck **lower levels** before trying another practice.

**Example:**
> Watch: *Reduction in repeated dependency delays within two sprints.*<br/>
> If not improved → revisit Levels 2 and 3 for unaddressed issues in feedback culture.

## Output Template

Use this lightweight template for documentation or reflection:

```
Observation:
Matrix cell:
Level(s) involved:
Function to strengthen:
Practice(s) selected:
Signal/metric to watch:
Review date:
```

You can use it in retrospectives, coaching sessions, or system diagnostics — it fits equally well in individual reflection or team learning contexts.

## Practical Example (Full Loop)

**Observation:**<br/>
“Design team’s updates rarely align with development progress; misinterpretations surface during QA.”

**Matrix Mapping:**<br/>
*Communication × Shared Understanding → Language / Terms*

**Level Check:**<br/>
Level 2–3 issue: weak shared understanding and coordination function.

**Function to Strengthen:**<br/>
Clarify shared vocabulary and decision handoffs.

**Practice(s):**<br/>
- Introduce weekly alignment review with both design and dev leads.
- Create a shared “definition of ready” document.

**Signal/Metric:**<br/>
Reduced QA rework or clarifications needed after handoff.

## Why It Matters

This workflow transforms **improvement discussions** from reactive fixes to **systemic diagnosis**.<br/>
It replaces “who made the mistake?” with “which part of the system is under strain?” — building psychological safety while improving results.

> The HCS Diagnostic Workflow is the bridge between **theory and daily practice** — a loop that keeps cooperation systems alive, adaptive, and learnable.

Used consistently, this workflow becomes the **practical heartbeat of HCS** — transforming abstract theory into measurable cooperative improvement.

### Summary Table

| Step | Purpose | Output |
|------|----------|---------|
| **1. Observation** | Capture neutral evidence | Statement of what happened |
| **2. Matrix Mapping** | Locate systemic dimension | Condition × Need = Function |
| **3. Level Check** | Identify root depth | Level(s) causing dysfunction |
| **4. Function → Practice** | Define safe intervention | Function and matching practice |
| **5. Trial & Learn** | Validate and adjust | Measurable feedback loop |

### Essence

> Every cooperation issue can be traced through the same lens:<br/>
> **Observation → Matrix → Level → Function → Practice → Learning.**

This is how theory becomes a living system.
