# Practices Map

This chapter provides a reference-level overview of commonly used practices that support either **Core Model functions** or **Extended Human Dynamics**.<br/>
Practices are included only to illustrate how teams often address specific conditions or needs. They are **optional**, **framework-neutral**, and **not prescriptive**.

Each practice is listed with:
- A brief functional purpose (what it helps with)
- Its HCS mapping (Core, Extended, or Mixed)
- A simple category for navigation

The intent is to offer **direction**, not detailed instruction.

## Legend

**Core** – Supports minimal structural conditions and needs of the HCS Core Model<br/>
**Extended** – Supports motivation, relational dynamics, psychological or political influences<br/>
**Mixed** – Addresses both Core and Extended dynamics

## How to Use This Map

These mappings describe *where practices are often helpful*, not required or recommended by HCS.

- Begin with the Core Model or Extended Dynamics to identify the primary condition or need.
- Select a practice that supports the function you are trying to explore or stabilize.
- Use practices **as inputs for discussion**, not as predefined solutions.
- Keep structural issues and human issues distinct when choosing interventions.
- Avoid using practices to “fix” what is actually a structural gap in the Core Model.

The Practices Map is intentionally **lightweight**.<br/>
Its purpose is to orient practitioners toward appropriate tools without prescribing methods or replacing agreements defined by HCS.
