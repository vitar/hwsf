# Integration Guide

The Core Model defines the structural foundation of cooperation.<br/>
Extended Human Dynamics describes the human and political forces that shape how cooperation is experienced.

This guide explains how to use both layers together in a coherent diagnostic flow, and how to choose interventions at the correct level without overreaching into areas that the Core Model does not attempt to govern.

The goal is to make cooperation understandable and actionable without simplifying the complexity of human systems.

## The Integration Principle

Use the Core Model to diagnose **structural** gaps.<br/>
Use the Extended Model to diagnose **human** and **political** distortions.

Both must be considered, but never confused.

**Structure first. Experience second.<br/>
Conditions before emotions.<br/>
Needs before tools.**

This ordering keeps interventions grounded, fair, and effective.

The Extended Model may enrich diagnosis, but it must never override a Core-level intervention.

## Step 1 — Start With the Core Model

Begin with the HCS matrix and pyramid:

- Identify which core conditions are missing or weak
- Confirm the level of alignment, clarity, and coordination
- Examine trust and purpose as system-level needs
- Test whether work is structured correctly for cooperation

If any core condition is broken, address it first.<br/>
Most recurring team issues originate from structural gaps.

Examples:

- Misalignment → unclear purpose or boundaries
- Coordination friction → missing feedback loops
- Tension and escalation → unclear decisions
- Blame and anxiety → weak visibility and trust

Extended dynamics should not be used as a substitute for structural clarity.

## Step 2 — Move to Extended Conditions and Needs

When the structure is intact but the cooperation still feels:

- tense
- fragile
- inconsistent
- political
- emotionally charged
- or confusing

then examine extended conditions and needs.

Use the collective/individual classification to pinpoint the level:

- **Collective** → norms, narratives, fairness, shared meaning
- **Individual** → motivation, autonomy, recognition, safety

This prevents misdiagnosis (e.g., assuming lack of motivation when the issue is unclear expectations).

## Step 3 — Evaluate Political and Psychological Vectors

Once the quadrant is clear, examine how influence fields affect it.

**Political vector**

- Power, visibility, resource control, legitimacy
- Hidden agendas or veto players
- Representation gaps
- Territorial behavior or informal hierarchies

**Psychological vector**

- Fear and uncertainty
- Status or identity threat
- Emotional triggers
- Self-censorship, avoidance, or defensiveness

This reveals why cooperation is distorted, even when structure appears correct.

## Step 4 — Select the Right Level of Intervention

Act where the issue truly lives.

### Structural interventions (Core)

- Clarify decisions and boundaries
- Increase visibility and feedback
- Stabilize commitments
- Re-align purpose or flow

### Collective interventions (Extended)

- Rebuild shared narrative
- Align expectations and agreements
- Improve representation and fairness
- Strengthen learning rhythms

### Relational interventions (Extended)

- Repair conflict
- Improve communication safety
- Build reciprocity and predictability

### Individual interventions (Extended)

- Clarify expectations
- Offer feedback or coaching
- Support emotional safety
- Address recognition or growth needs

Selecting the wrong level creates new dysfunction.

## Step 5 — Use Practices as Inputs, Not Prescriptions

Practices listed in the map (e.g., DiSC, Moving Motivators, RACI, NVC) support exploration, not enforcement.

Use them to:

- generate insight
- create vocabulary
- surface hidden patterns
- support agreements

Do **not** use them to:

- override structure
- assign identity labels
- replace the Core Model
- fix political issues with personal coaching
- fix structural issues with emotional tools 

The system dictates the boundaries.
Practices support conversation within those boundaries.

## Step 6 — Close the Loop

After intervening:

- re-check the Core Model
- confirm structural alignment
- confirm extended tensions have softened
- update agreements if needed
- document insights for collective memory

This loop maintains cooperative stability across time.

## How This Guide Fits Within HCS

The Integration Guide is not an additional model.<br/>
It is a practical bridge that ensures:

- the Core Model stays clean and universal
- extended dynamics do not dilute structural clarity
- practitioners avoid misdiagnosis
- leadership tools are used intentionally
- interventions land at the correct systemic level

It aligns the human experience with the structural design, creating cooperation that is both **stable** and **humane**, both **clear** and **adaptive**.
