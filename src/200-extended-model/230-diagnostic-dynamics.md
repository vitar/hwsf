# Diagnostic Dynamics

Extended Human Dynamics introduces two cross-cutting influence fields—**political** and **psychological**—that shape how cooperation behaves beyond its structural foundation. These forces do not alter the Core Model, but they can distort, suppress, amplify, or obstruct its conditions and needs.

This chapter provides a diagnostic lens for identifying how extended conditions and needs are affected, and how to choose the correct intervention level: individual, collective, or structural.

## Political and Psychological Vectors

The Core Model defines what cooperation requires.<br/>
Extended conditions and needs describe what cooperation feels like.

Political and psychological vectors explain **why cooperation becomes difficult**, even when structure is in place.

### Political Vector

Political influences emerge from:

- Power dynamics
- Resource control
- Legitimacy battles
- Visibility and influence
- Representation and agenda-setting
- Hidden coalitions or veto players

These forces affect how decisions are made, who shapes direction, and whose interests prevail under pressure.

### Psychological Vector

Psychological influences emerge from:

- Fear, anxiety, loss of safety
- Identity and status threat
- Emotional triggers, biases, and narratives
- Trust posture and previous experiences
- Vulnerability patterns and self-protection
- Perceived fairness

These forces affect how people interpret behavior, respond to tension, and decide whether to contribute, withdraw, or protect themselves.

## How Vectors Influence Conditions and Needs

Both vectors can act on **any** extended condition or need.<br/>
Their impact may be visible or subtle, temporary or persistent.

Examples:

- A collective structural condition (e.g., boundary clarity) becomes distorted under political pressure when influence flows outside formal decisions.
- A personal autonomy need becomes distorted under psychological tension when individuals self-censor or avoid taking initiative.
- A collective purpose need becomes distorted when the narrative is shaped by a few powerful actors.

Political vectors affect **permission**.<br/>
Psychological vectors affect **participation**.

## The Diagnosis Framework

To diagnose extended dynamics, evaluate three layers in order:

### 1. Identify the Quadrant

Determine where the issue is primarily visible.

- **Collective Condition**
- **Individual Condition**
- **Collective Need**
- **Individual Need**

This prevents wrong-level interventions (e.g., coaching a person when the collective structure is broken).

### 2. Examine Field Impact

Assess how political or psychological forces influence the issue.

**Political signals**

- Unseen decision-makers
- Resource bottlenecks
- Alliance patterns
- Visibility bias
- Veto power
- Agenda manipulation
- Territorial behavior

**Psychological signals**

- Self-censorship
- Avoidance or withdrawal
- Emotional escalation or shutdown
- Overreaction to ambiguity
- Sensitivity to fairness
- Defensive communication
- Loss of motivation or identity threat

### 3. Select the Intervention Level

Once the quadrant and field are clear, choose an intervention at the appropriate level:

**Structural**

- Rebuild boundaries
- Clarify decisions
- Increase transparency
- Introduce or repair feedback loops

**Collective**

- Align purpose or narrative
- Establish shared agreements
- Run inclusion or representation checks
- Strengthen learning rhythms

**Relational**

- Facilitate conflict repair
- Rebuild reciprocity norms
- Improve communication safety

**Individual**

- Support psychological safety
- Develop emotional literacy
- Provide coaching or mentoring
- Improve clarity and expectations

The goal is to act **where the problem actually lives**, not where it is easiest or most comfortable to intervene.

## Practical Heuristics

Use the following heuristics to quickly diagnose complexity:

**“If structure is clear but behavior is erratic, check psychological vectors.”**<br/>
Fear, identity, and ambiguity often override clarity.

**“If individuals keep failing in the same way, check collective conditions.”**<br/>
People adapt to the system they’re in.

**“If the story makes sense to leadership but not to the team, check political vectors.”**<br/>
Narratives often serve the interests of those who shape them.

**“If conflict repeats, examine unmet needs, not personalities.”**<br/>
Unmet needs create predictable patterns of resistance or withdrawal.

**“If people stop speaking up, treat this as a system failure, not a personal flaw.”**<br/>
Silence is a political and psychological signal.

## How to Use This Chapter in Practice

This diagnostic layer is designed to be used:

- After the Core Model has been applied
- When structural issues are ruled out or insufficient
- When friction persists despite clear agreements
- When cooperation feels tense, fragile, or confusing
- When teams experience recurring interpersonal issues
- When politics or emotional dynamics distort work

The goal is not to solve human psychology or organizational politics, but to **make their influence visible**.<br/>
Once visible, they can be addressed at the right level—without expanding the Core Model, and without blaming individuals for systemic patterns.

Extended diagnostic dynamics help teams navigate the real-world complexity of cooperation with clarity, empathy, and precision.
