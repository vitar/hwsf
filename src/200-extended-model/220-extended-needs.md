# Extended Needs

Core Needs (trust, purpose, commitment) define structural sufficiency; Extended Needs describe motivational depth.<br>
Extended needs describe the deeper human and systemic requirements that influence how cooperation is experienced and sustained over time.<br/>
They complement the Core Model by acknowledging that people bring motivation, emotion, identity, and expectations that shape the quality of cooperation beyond the minimal conditions of stability.

These needs are *not part of the minimal HCS matrix*.<br/>
Cooperation can function without them, but it will often feel strained, brittle, or transactional.

Extended needs are classified as **Collective** or **Individual** and organized into five functional categories. Each need can be examined through potential **political** and **psychological** impact vectors to understand how it becomes distorted under tension.

## Collective vs Individual Needs

Extended needs arise at two connected levels:

- **Collective needs**<br/>
  Shared meaning, fairness, legitimacy, and identity. These shape how groups hold purpose together and maintain cohesion during change.

- **Individual needs**<br/>
  Personal motivation, recognition, autonomy, and emotional safety. These shape how each person engages with cooperation and interprets their role in it.

Both levels interact continuously.<br/>
When collective needs weaken, individuals disengage.<br/>
When individual needs are unmet, collective dynamics destabilize.

## Types of Extended Needs

Extended needs fall into five categories that influence motivation, coherence, and resilience within cooperative systems.

### 1. Purpose & Direction

Needs related to meaning, intention, and contribution.

**Collective Needs**

- Shared sense of purpose
- Legitimacy of direction and goals
- Relevance of the work to broader context
- Identity as a group with a coherent mission

**Individual Needs**

- Personal meaning in the work
- Sense of contribution to something valuable
- Alignment between values and daily actions
- Clarity about “why my role matters”

**Political impact:** who defines purpose, whose interests shape direction<br/>
**Psychological impact:** pride, disillusionment, loss of meaning

### 2. Trust & Safety

Needs related to vulnerability, honesty, and perceived security.

**Collective Needs**

- Systemic fairness
- Transparent communication
- Predictable commitments and follow-through
- Safety in raising issues or challenging assumptions

**Individual Needs**

- Psychological safety
- Confidence that honesty does not result in punishment
- Predictability in relationships
- Emotional security in uncertain situations

**Political impact:** fear of retaliation, status risk, exclusion<br/>
**Psychological impact:** anxiety, withdrawal, defensive behavior

### 3. Growth & Evolution

Needs related to improvement, mastery, and progression.

**Collective Needs**

- Shared learning rhythms
- Integration of insights into future work
- Collective progression toward mastery
- Capacity to adapt without losing coherence

**Individual Needs**

- Skill development and mastery
- Constructive feedback and support
- Opportunities for growth or new challenges
- A sense of becoming “better over time”

**Political impact:** whose growth is prioritized, who gets opportunities<br/>
**Psychological impact:** stagnation, frustration, loss of motivation

### 4. Recognition & Belonging

Needs related to appreciation, inclusion, and social identity.

**Collective Needs**

- Culture of appreciation
- Inclusion mechanisms that ensure representation
- Fair allocation of credit
- Shared rituals that build connection

**Individual Needs**

- Feeling valued and seen
- Belonging to the group
- Recognition for contributions
- Acceptance without needing to perform or protect status

**Political impact:** favoritism, visibility bias, gatekeeping<br/>
**Psychological impact:** loneliness, envy, shame, loss of identity

### 5. Autonomy & Coherence

Needs related to freedom, agency, and alignment.

**Collective Needs**

- Coherent decision-making across roles
- Boundary clarity between functions
- Distributed authority that matches responsibility
- Consistency of decisions with shared principles

**Individual Needs**

- Freedom to make informed decisions
- Sense of agency and ownership
- Space to act without micromanagement
- Clarity of how personal choices fit the whole

**Political impact:** overreach, territorialism, centralization of control<br/>
**Psychological impact:** dependency, helplessness, reactive resistance

## Why Extended Needs Matter

Extended needs explain variation in **motivation**, **engagement**, and **cooperation quality** that structural models often cannot capture.<br/>
They highlight why teams with the same processes can behave very differently, and why cooperation often degrades slowly rather than collapsing suddenly.

Understanding extended needs helps practitioners:

- See the difference between structural alignment and human experience
- Avoid over-focusing on tools or processes when motivation is the root issue
- Detect early signals of disengagement, resentment, or fragmentation
- Choose the right level of intervention: individual, relational, or collective
- Address political and psychological distortions before they escalate
- Support stable cooperation without inflating the Core Model

Extended needs make the human dimension of cooperation **explicit**, enabling leaders and teams to navigate complexity with greater clarity and empathy.
