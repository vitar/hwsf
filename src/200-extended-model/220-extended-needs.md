# Extended Needs

Cooperation can be **structurally sufficient** and still feel brittle, unfair, or exhausting.

The **Core Model** defines the minimum cooperative needs required for work to function (Level 2 of the Pyramid):  
Shared Understanding, Mutual Commitment, Feedback Loops, Distribution of Roles, Autonomy & Agency.

**Extended Needs** describe the deeper human and systemic requirements that influence:

- how cooperation is experienced,  
- how motivation is sustained, and  
- how resilient the system is under stress.

These needs are **not part of the minimal HCS Matrix**.  
Cooperation can function without them, but it will often feel strained, transactional, or fragile.

Extended Needs are:

- classified as **Collective** or **Individual**, and  
- organized into five **functional categories**.  

Each need can be examined through potential **political** and **psychological** impact vectors to understand how it becomes distorted under tension.

Extended Needs complement the **Extended Conditions** by focusing on **what people and groups seek**, not just **what context they inhabit**.

## Core vs Extended Needs

It is important to distinguish:

- **Core cooperative needs** (Level 2 of the Pyramid)  
  - Shared Understanding  
  - Mutual Commitment  
  - Feedback Loops  
  - Distribution of Roles  
  - Autonomy & Agency  

  These are the **minimal human requirements** for cooperation to function at all.

- **Extended Needs** (this section)  
  - Purpose & Direction  
  - Trust & Safety  
  - Growth & Evolution  
  - Recognition & Belonging  
  - Autonomy & Coherence  

  These are **deeper motivational needs** that shape the *quality* and *emotional tone* of cooperation.

Core Needs answer:  
> “Do people have enough to participate in cooperation sustainably?”

Extended Needs answer:  
> “Does this cooperation feel meaningful, fair, and worth sustaining over time?”

Both are real. Only the first group is encoded in the Core Model.

## Collective vs Individual Needs

Extended Needs arise at two connected levels:

- **Collective Needs**  
  Shared meaning, fairness, legitimacy, and identity.  
  These shape how groups hold purpose together and maintain cohesion during change.

- **Individual Needs**  
  Personal motivation, recognition, autonomy, and emotional safety.  
  These shape how each person engages with cooperation and interprets their role in it.

Both levels interact continuously:

- When **collective needs** weaken, individuals disengage or protect themselves.  
- When **individual needs** are chronically unmet, collective dynamics destabilize.

Extended Needs help practitioners see both levels without collapsing everything into “culture” or “attitude”.

## Types of Extended Needs

Extended Needs fall into five categories that influence motivation, coherence, and resilience within cooperative systems.

### Purpose & Direction

Needs related to meaning, intention, and contribution.

**Collective Needs**

- Shared sense of purpose  
- Legitimacy of direction and goals  
- Relevance of the work to a broader context  
- Identity as a group with a coherent mission  

**Individual Needs**

- Personal meaning in the work  
- Sense of contribution to something valuable  
- Alignment between values and daily actions  
- Clarity about “why my role matters”  

**Political impact:**  
Who defines purpose, whose interests shape direction, which voices are included or excluded when goals are set.

**Psychological impact:**  
Pride, commitment, and energy when needs are met; disillusionment, cynicism, or loss of meaning when they are not.

### Trust & Safety

Needs related to vulnerability, honesty, and perceived security.

**Collective Needs**

- Systemic fairness (rules apply consistently)  
- Transparent communication about risks and constraints  
- Predictable commitments and follow-through  
- Safety in raising issues or challenging assumptions  

**Individual Needs**

- Psychological safety in conversations and decisions  
- Confidence that honesty does not result in punishment  
- Predictability in key relationships  
- Emotional security when facing uncertainty or change  

**Political impact:**  
Fear of retaliation, status risk, exclusion, and invisible power; “safe for some, dangerous for others.”

**Psychological impact:**  
Anxiety, withdrawal, defensiveness, or hypervigilance when safety is low; openness and calm engagement when safety is high.

### Growth & Evolution

Needs related to improvement, mastery, and progression.

**Collective Needs**

- Shared learning rhythms (retrospectives, reviews, open dialogue)  
- Integration of insights into future work, not just storing them  
- Collective progression toward greater mastery  
- Capacity to adapt without losing coherence or identity  

**Individual Needs**

- Skill development and increasing mastery  
- Constructive feedback and support  
- Opportunities for growth or new challenges  
- A sense of becoming “better over time”  

**Political impact:**  
Whose growth is prioritized, who gets opportunities, who is “invested in” vs merely “used”.

**Psychological impact:**  
Stagnation, frustration, or quiet resignation when needs are unmet; motivation and engagement when growth is visible and supported.

### Recognition & Belonging

Needs related to appreciation, inclusion, and social identity.

**Collective Needs**

- Culture of appreciation, not just criticism  
- Inclusion mechanisms that ensure representation and voice  
- Fair allocation of credit and visibility  
- Shared rituals that build connection and identity  

**Individual Needs**

- Feeling valued and seen as a person, not just a resource  
- Belonging to the group without constant self-protection  
- Recognition for contributions and effort  
- Acceptance without needing to constantly prove worth or status  

**Political impact:**  
Favoritism, visibility bias, gatekeeping, and “inner circles”.

**Psychological impact:**  
Loneliness, envy, shame, loss of identity, or over-identification with status; versus a grounded sense of being part of “us”.

### Autonomy & Coherence

Needs related to freedom, agency, and alignment.

**Collective Needs**

- Coherent decision-making across roles and teams  
- Boundary clarity between functions and responsibilities  
- Distributed authority that matches real responsibility  
- Consistency of decisions with stated principles and strategy  

**Individual Needs**

- Freedom to make informed decisions in one’s domain  
- Sense of agency and ownership over outcomes  
- Space to act without micromanagement  
- Clarity about how personal choices affect the whole system  

**Political impact:**  
Overreach, territorialism, centralization of control, and token autonomy.

**Psychological impact:**  
Dependency, helplessness, reactive resistance, or burnout when needs are unmet; grounded confidence and initiative when they are met.

## Why Extended Needs Matter

Extended Needs explain variation in **motivation**, **engagement**, and **cooperation quality** that structural models alone cannot capture.

They highlight why teams with the same processes and structures can behave very differently, and why cooperation often degrades slowly rather than collapsing suddenly:

- from committed to compliant,  
- from transparent to guarded,  
- from adaptive to rigid,  
- from “we” to isolated “me”.

Understanding Extended Needs helps practitioners:

- See the difference between **structural alignment** and **human experience**.  
- Avoid over-focusing on tools or processes when motivation or meaning is the root issue.  
- Detect early signals of disengagement, resentment, or quiet fragmentation.  
- Choose the right level of intervention: **individual, relational, collective, or structural**.  
- Recognize when political or psychological distortions, not just process gaps, are driving behavior.

Extended Needs make the human dimension of cooperation **explicit** without inflating the Core Model.  
They prepare the ground for **System Modes**, where teams decide *how* to act on these insights over time — whether to design, stabilize, grow, resolve conflict, or reset the cooperation system.
