# Extended Conditions

## Purpose of Extended Conditions

The **Core Model** defines the minimum structural conditions that make cooperation possible:  
Common Purpose, Interdependence, Communication, Trust, and Change / Uncertainty tolerance – plus the human needs that interact with them in the [Matrix](../100-core-model/110-matrix.md) and [Pyramid](../100-core-model/120-pyramid.md).

In practice, cooperation is also shaped by a wider set of **contextual, relational, structural, and developmental** influences.  
These are the **Extended Conditions**.

Extended conditions:

- do **not** change the Core Model or its Matrix,  
- are **not required** for cooperation to exist at all,  
- but strongly affect **how cooperation feels**, how it behaves under stress, and how fragile or resilient it becomes.

They help explain why a system that looks “correct” on paper may still be experienced as unfair, unsafe, or exhausting in reality.

Extended conditions are described along two lenses:

- **Collective vs Individual**  
- **Political and Psychological impacts**

They are most relevant when deciding whether a challenge calls for **structural changes**, **collective renegotiation**, or **individual support**.

## Collective vs Individual Conditions

Extended conditions arise at two intertwined levels:

### Collective Conditions

System-wide patterns that shape the environment in which cooperation happens:

- Cultural norms and shared narratives  
- Incentive structures and governance mechanisms  
- How decisions are made and communicated  
- How stable or volatile constraints appear to be

Collective conditions influence **what is possible** in the system.

### Individual Conditions

The personal experience of living inside those collective patterns:

- How predictable the environment feels  
- How safe it feels to speak, disagree, or experiment  
- How much control one feels over daily work  
- How much one identifies with the group or mission

Individual conditions influence **what is experienced** by each person.

Both levels matter:

- Changing only individual attitudes without addressing collective conditions leads to burnout and self-blame.  
- Changing only collective structures without addressing individual experience leads to quiet disengagement.

Extended conditions help practitioners keep both in view.

## Types of Extended Conditions

Extended conditions are grouped into four types that frequently show up in cooperation challenges.  
They are **not new dimensions** of the Core Model – they are lenses to understand how the system behaves in real organizations.

Each type includes **collective** and **individual** variants, plus typical **political** and **psychological** impacts.

### Contextual Conditions

These describe the broader environment surrounding cooperation.

#### Collective Contextual Conditions

- Cultural climate and day-to-day tone  
- Communication norms across roles and levels  
- Predictability of governance and decision patterns  
- Transparency of goals, constraints, and trade-offs  
- Stability of priorities, timelines, and commitments

#### Individual Contextual Conditions

- Perceived stability of workload and expectations  
- Personal clarity about “what matters now”  
- Ability to anticipate changes that affect one’s work  
- Sense of control over environment, tools, and schedule

**Political impact:**  
Who sets the context, whose priorities define “reality,” how visible or opaque decisions are.

**Psychological impact:**  
Uncertainty, anxiety, vigilance, or ease; perceived safety in the face of change.

### Relational Conditions

These describe how people relate, interpret, and respond to one another.

#### Collective Relational Conditions

- Norms of reciprocity, fairness, and repair  
- Predictability of behavior across roles and teams  
- Accepted ways of handling disagreement and escalation  
- Shared vs fragmented interpretation of problems and success

#### Individual Relational Conditions

- Default trust posture toward peers and leaders  
- Openness vs self-censorship in communication  
- Capacity for empathy and perspective-taking  
- Emotional responses to tension, conflict, or critique

**Political impact:**  
Alliances, informal influence, exclusion, hidden agendas, and “who speaks for whom.”

**Psychological impact:**  
Fear of loss, defensiveness, shame, guilt, emotional contagion, or genuine solidarity.

### Structural Conditions

These describe how formal and informal structures support or constrain cooperation beyond the Core Model’s basic boundaries.

#### Collective Structural Conditions

- Boundary clarity: who decides, who contributes, who is accountable  
- How feedback and progress visibility are built into the system  
- Access to resources, tools, and information across roles  
- Alignment or mismatch between formal organization charts and actual working patterns

#### Individual Structural Conditions

- Perceived autonomy and real decision authority  
- Ability to escalate issues without backlash  
- Clarity of one’s own role, scope, and dependencies  
- Access to information and support needed for daily work

**Political impact:**  
Gatekeeping, veto positions, resource control, “choke points” in the system.

**Psychological impact:**  
Overcontrol, learned helplessness, confusion, or a sense of empowerment and legitimacy.

### Developmental Conditions

These describe how the cooperative system – and the people in it – learn and evolve over time.

#### Collective Developmental Conditions

- Learning rhythms (retrospectives, reviews, open dialogue)  
- How the organization remembers and reuses learning  
- Adaptability to changing constraints and opportunities  
- Evolution of shared narratives, identity, and rituals

#### Individual Developmental Conditions

- Personal reflection and self-assessment habits  
- Curiosity, openness to feedback, and willingness to experiment  
- Ability to integrate new insights into behavior and decisions  
- Sense of progress, growth, and increasing mastery

**Political impact:**  
Whose learning “counts,” whose ideas shape direction, who is allowed to experiment.

**Psychological impact:**  
Pride, motivation, frustration, shame, identity protection, or a sense of stagnation.

## Why Extended Conditions Matter

Extended conditions explain **variation in cooperation quality** that the Core Model alone cannot:

- why a structurally sound setup still feels hostile or fragile,  
- why teams drift into avoidance, conflict, or apathy without any obvious change in roles or process,  
- why attempts to “fix” cooperation at practice level (Level 4) fail when deeper contextual or relational issues remain untouched.

They help practitioners:

- Distinguish **structural** problems from **cultural** or **interpersonal** ones.  
- Avoid mislabeling behavior as “resistance” or “attitude” when it is a rational response to conditions.  
- Identify when Encapsulation (narrowing collaboration) is a protective response to unsafe or unpredictable dynamics.  
- Decide whether an issue calls for **system redesign**, **collective renegotiation**, **individual support**, or a dedicated **System Mode** (e.g., Conflict or Reset).

Extended conditions make cooperation **legible at a human level** without overloading the Core Model.  
They provide the bridge between:

- the structural “physics” of HCS, and  
- the lived experience of people working inside real organizations.

The next section on **Extended Needs** builds on this foundation to describe how these conditions interact with deeper human needs, shaping motivation, perception, and behavior over time.
