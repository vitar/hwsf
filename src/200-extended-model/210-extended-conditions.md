# Extended Conditions

The Core Model defines the minimum structural conditions that make cooperation possible.<br/>
Extended conditions describe **additional systemic influences** that shape how cooperation feels, how it behaves under pressure, and how predictable or fragile it becomes.

These conditions do **not** modify the HCS matrix and are **not required** for cooperation to exist.<br/>
Instead, they help practitioners understand why cooperation can still be difficult—even when the structural system is intact.

Extended conditions are grouped into four types and classified as **Collective** or **Individual**, with each condition examined through potential **political** and **psychological** impacts.

## Collective vs Individual Conditions

Extended conditions arise at two levels:

- **Collective conditions**<br/>
  System-wide patterns, norms, cultural narratives, structural incentives, and governance mechanisms that influence how groups coordinate and interpret each other.

- **Individual conditions**<br/>
  The personal experience of operating within the system: perceived clarity, agency, predictability, and emotional posture under daily workload and uncertainty.

Both levels matter.<br/>
Collective conditions influence what is possible.<br/>
Individual conditions influence what is experienced.

## Types of Extended Conditions

Extended conditions fall into four functional categories.<br/>
Each category contains both collective and individual variants.

### 1. Contextual Conditions

These describe the broader environment surrounding cooperation.

**Collective Contextual Conditions**

- Cultural climate and communication norms
- Institutional maturity and governance predictability
- Transparency of goals, constraints, and decisions
- Stability of timelines, priorities, and commitments

**Individual Contextual Conditions**

- Perceived stability and workload rhythm
- Clarity about expectations and consequences
- Personal ability to anticipate changes
- Sense of control over one’s daily work environment

**Political impact:** shifts in power, influence, and decision visibility<br/>
**Psychological impact:** uncertainty, anxiety, perceived safety

### 2. Relational Conditions

These describe how people relate, interpret, and respond to one another.

**Collective Relational Conditions**

- Norms of reciprocity and fairness
- Predictability of behavior across roles
- Conflict safety and repair capacity
- Shared interpretation of problems and success

**Individual Relational Conditions**

- Trust posture toward peers and leaders
- Openness or self-censorship in communication
- Empathy and ability to read others
- Emotional responses to tension or disagreement

**Political impact:** alliances, hidden agendas, representation<br/>
**Psychological impact:** fear of loss, defensiveness, emotional contagion

### 3. Structural Conditions

These describe how the organization’s design supports or constrains cooperation.

**Collective Structural Conditions**

- Boundary clarity: who decides, who contributes, who is accountable
- Feedback mechanisms and visibility of progress
- Access to resources, tools, and information
- Alignment between formal structures and actual working practices

**Individual Structural Conditions**

- Perceived autonomy and decision authority
- Ability to escalate issues safely
- Clarity of one’s own role and dependencies
- Access to information needed for daily work

**Political impact:** gatekeeping, veto players, resource control<br/>
**Psychological impact:** overcontrol, learned helplessness, ambiguity stress

### 4. Developmental Conditions

These describe how cooperation grows, learns, and adapts over time.

**Collective Developmental Conditions**

- Learning rhythms (retrospectives, reviews, dialogue)
- Collective memory and knowledge retention
- Adaptability to changing constraints
- Evolution of shared narratives and identity

**Individual Developmental Conditions**

- Personal reflection and learning habits
- Curiosity and openness to feedback
- Ability to integrate new insights into behavior
- Sense of progress and skill development

**Political impact:** whose learning “counts,” whose ideas shape direction<br/>
**Psychological impact:** pride, shame, motivation, identity protection

## Why Extended Conditions Matter

Extended conditions explain **variation in cooperation quality** that the Core Model alone cannot:<br/>
hidden friction, persistent misalignment, misunderstandings, slow drift toward dysfunction, and emotional responses under pressure.

They help practitioners:

- Diagnose subtle system problems earlier
- Distinguish structural issues from cultural or interpersonal ones
- Prevent misinterpretation of behavior as “resistance” or “attitude”
- Address political and psychological distortions safely
- Prepare the system for better cooperation without changing the core model

Extended conditions make cooperation **legible** at a human level, allowing better reasoning, better agreements, and better leadership interventions.
