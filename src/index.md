# Human Cooperation System (HCS) – From Context to Practice

> A diagnostic lens for understanding how human cooperation enables effective work.

!!! warning "DRAFT VERSION"
    This document is a **working draft** of the *Human Cooperation System (HCS)*.<br/>
    Content, terminology, and structure are **subject to revision**.

## Introduction

The **Human Cooperation System (HCS)** explores how people manage to work together — not as isolated individuals, but as interdependent actors connected by shared goals, constraints, and meaning.<br/>
It focuses on the *invisible architecture* that makes cooperation possible: the conditions, needs, and functions that hold any collaborative system together.

When collaboration fails, it is rarely due to lack of skill or effort — it usually breaks at the **system level**: misaligned expectations, unmet human needs, or missing functions that maintain trust and coherence.<br/>
HCS helps reveal these root causes before they manifest as friction, disengagement, or project failure.

## Who It’s For

HCS is designed for people who lead, enable, or study cooperation:

- **Project and Product Leads** seeking to understand why delivery struggles despite competent teams.
- **Engineering and Design Managers** working to improve cross-functional collaboration and autonomy.
- **Consultants and Coaches** diagnosing organizational misalignment or low trust between groups.
- **Researchers and Framework Builders** exploring universal patterns behind effective human cooperation.

If you’ve arrived here from **3SF (3-in-3 SDLC Framework)** or similar models, HCS represents the *layer beneath practice* — the foundational system that governs why engagement, delivery, and value either flow or fail.

## Purpose

HCS serves as a **diagnostic system** for understanding and improving cooperation across all forms of human work — from teams and organizations to partnerships and ecosystems.
It does not prescribe methods; instead, it offers a *lens* to evaluate which functions must be present and coherent for cooperation to succeed.

- It describes the **preconditions** that enable cooperation.
- It identifies **human needs** that sustain motivation and trust.
- It defines **stable functions** that turn shared intent into collective outcomes.

Together, these dimensions form the **Systemic Basis of Work** — what must exist before practices, tools, or frameworks can be effective.

## Read This First

1. Start with the **[Matrix](100-theory/110-matrix.md)** to see the five-by-five landscape of *conditions × needs*.
2. Use the **[Pyramid](100-theory/120-pyramid.md)** to understand levels from *preconditions → practices*.
3. Apply **[The Level Rule](100-theory/130-level-rule.md)** before prescribing practices.
4. Run the **[Diagnostic Workflow](100-theory/140-diagnostic-workflow.md)** on real observations.

## Positioning

Think of **HCS** as the *operating system* beneath all frameworks and practices.<br/>
Tools like Agile, Lean, or management methodologies can only succeed when the system-level conditions of cooperation are stable.<br/>
By understanding and diagnosing those foundations, leaders and teams can work with greater clarity, trust, and purpose.
