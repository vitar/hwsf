# Human Cooperation System (HCS) – From Context to Practice

A diagnostic system for understanding how human cooperation sustains effective work.

> **30-Second Summary**<br/>
> The **Human Cooperation System (HCS)** is a diagnostic lens that defines the **25 stable functions required for human cooperation to exist and adapt**.<br/>
> It helps leaders and teams see where trust, clarity, or structure must be strengthened before changing practices or frameworks.

## Introduction

The **Human Cooperation System (HCS)** explains how people manage to work together — not as isolated individuals, but as interdependent actors connected by shared goals, constraints, and meaning.<br/>
It maps the *invisible architecture* that makes cooperation possible: the conditions, needs, and functions that hold any collaborative system together.

When collaboration fails, it is rarely a skills problem — it usually breaks at the **system level**: misaligned expectations, unmet human needs, or missing functions that maintain trust and coherence.<br/>
HCS helps reveal these root causes before they manifest as friction, disengagement, or delivery failure.

## Who It’s For

HCS is built for those who lead, enable, or study cooperation:

- **Project and Product Leads** seeking to understand why delivery struggles despite competent teams.
- **Engineering and Design Managers** improving cross-functional flow, trust, and autonomy.
- **Consultants and Coaches** diagnosing organizational misalignment or systemic friction.
- **Researchers and Framework Designers** exploring universal patterns behind human collaboration.

If you’ve arrived here from the **3-in-3 SDLC Framework (3SF)**, HCS represents the **layer beneath practice** — the foundational *system* that governs why engagement, delivery, and value either flow or fail.

## Purpose

HCS serves as a **diagnostic and theoretical system** for understanding and improving cooperation across all forms of human work — from teams and organizations to partnerships and ecosystems.<br/>
It does not prescribe methods; instead, it offers a *lens* to evaluate which functions must exist and interact coherently for cooperation to succeed.

- It describes the **preconditions** that enable cooperation.
- It identifies the **human needs** that sustain motivation and trust.
- It defines the **stable functions** that transform shared intent into collective outcomes.

Together, these dimensions form the **Systemic Basis of Work** — the foundation upon which all frameworks, practices, and tools must rest.

## Structure of the System

HCS is organized into two complementary layers:

### **Core Model**

The Core Model defines the **minimal systemic conditions, human needs, and functional primitives** required for cooperation to exist.<br/>
It answers:<br/>
**What must be true for people to work together at all?**

This layer includes:

- Foundations, principles, and beliefs
- The 5×5 Matrix of conditions × needs
- The Pyramid (Preconditions → Meta-Practices)
- The Level Rule
- The Diagnostic Workflow

The Core Model is universal, stable, and framework-independent.

### **Extended Human Dynamics**

Beyond the structural minimum, cooperation is shaped by **contextual, psychological, and political forces** that influence how work is experienced.

This layer answers:<br/>
**Why is cooperation difficult in real organizations?**

It describes:

- Collective and individual variations in conditions and needs
- Psychological and political vectors that distort cooperation
- Relational, cultural, and developmental dynamics
- Reference practices used to explore these dynamics

The Extended layer does **not** modify the Core Model.<br/>
It provides a vocabulary for diagnosing human complexity without turning HCS into a behavior-change framework.

## Reading Path

### Start with the **Core Model**

1. Begin with the **[Vision, Principles, and Beliefs](100-core-model/100-vision-principles-beliefs.md)** to understand HCS intent and mindset.
2. Explore the **[Matrix](100-core-model/110-matrix.md)** — a five-by-five landscape of *conditions × needs*.
3. Study the **[Pyramid](100-core-model/120-pyramid.md)** to see how stability develops from *preconditions → meta-practices*.
4. Apply **[The Level Rule](100-core-model/130-level-rule.md)** to identify where interventions must start.
5. Use the **[Diagnostic Workflow](100-core-model/140-diagnostic-workflow.md)** to turn observations into action.

### Continue with **Extended Human Dynamics** (optional, recommended)

If the Core Model is clear but cooperation still feels tense, political, or emotionally difficult, proceed to:

- **[Extended Conditions](200-extended-model/210-extended-conditions.md)**
- **[Extended Needs](200-extended-model/220-extended-needs.md)**
- **[Diagnostic Dynamics](200-extended-model/230-diagnostic-dynamics.md)**
- **[Practices Map](200-extended-model/240-practices-map.md)**
- **[Integration Guide](200-extended-model/250-integration-guide.md)**

This layer helps diagnose complexity without conflating human issues with structural ones.

## Positioning

Think of **HCS** as the *operating system* beneath all collaborative frameworks and management methodologies.<br/>
Agile, Lean, and other methods work only when the **systemic conditions of cooperation** are stable.<br/>
By diagnosing and strengthening those foundations, leaders and teams can achieve higher trust, clearer intent, and sustainable performance.

> **In essence:**<br/>
> **HCS** defines the *physics of cooperation* — how alignment, trust, and feedback sustain work —<br/>
> and provides the foundation for applied frameworks such as **3SF**, where theory meets practice.
