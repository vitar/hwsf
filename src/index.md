**Human Work System Framework (HWSF)** is a *theory-first lens* that describes the **preconditions, human needs, and stable functions** required for any collaborative work to exist and succeed.

1. Start with the **[Matrix](100-theory/110-matrix.md)** to see the five-by-five landscape of conditions × needs.
2. Use the **[Pyramid](100-theory/120-pyramid.md)** to understand levels from *preconditions → practices*.
3. Apply **[The Level Rule](100-theory/130-level-rule.md)** before prescribing practices.
4. Run the **[Diagnostic Workflow](100-theory/140-diagnostic-workflow.md)** on real observations.
