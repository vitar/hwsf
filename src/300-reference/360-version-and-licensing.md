### Version Summary

Version 1.0 consolidates the **foundational architecture** of the Human Cooperation System across two complementary layers:

- **Core Model** — the structural foundation of cooperation, including the 5×5 Matrix, Pyramid, Level Rule, and Diagnostic Workflow.
- **Extended Human Dynamics** — classification of collective and individual conditions and needs, and the influence of psychological and political vectors on real-world cooperation.
- **Reference Practices Map** — a non-prescriptive orientation linking common leadership and communication practices to relevant HCS functions.
- **Reference Section** — Glossary and theoretical sources covering systemic, psychological, relational, and governance influences.

This release establishes HCS as a **complete V1.0 system**:<br/>
a stable theoretical base (Core Model) and a complementary human-centered layer (Extended Dynamics), suitable for diagnostics, education, and derivative frameworks such as 3SF.
