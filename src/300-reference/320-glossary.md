# Glossary

The **Human Cooperation System (HCS)** defines a foundational language for describing the dynamics of **cooperative work systems** — how individuals and groups align, commit, and adapt together across levels of stability and change.<br/>
This glossary supports consistency across HCS Core Model, Pyramid, Matrix, and Diagnostic Workflow.

## Core System Terms

| Term | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Human Cooperation System (HCS)** | A diagnostic system that explains how cooperative work remains stable and adaptive across changing conditions. It models the “physics” of collaboration using the Pyramid, Matrix, and Level Rule. |
| **Pyramid Model** | Hierarchical structure of stability, from foundational human conditions (Level 1) to reflective meta-practices (Level 5). |
| **Matrix Model (5×5)** | Two-dimensional map crossing five cooperative dimensions with five human conditions to identify functional gaps or tensions in a system. |
| **Level Rule** | Governing principle stating that dysfunction at a lower level cannot be resolved by interventions at higher levels. Stability must be restored bottom-up. |
| **Diagnostic Workflow** | A repeatable method for observing behaviors, identifying affected levels and functions, and selecting interventions that respect the Level Rule. |

## Foundational Conditions (Pyramid Level 1)

| Term | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Common Purpose** | The shared intent that gives meaning and direction to collective effort. |
| **Shared Understanding** | The degree to which participants interpret information and goals in the same way. |
| **Mutual Commitment** | The willingness of each participant to invest effort and uphold agreements that sustain cooperation. |
| **Trust** | Confidence that others will act reliably and with integrity within shared norms. |
| **Interdependence** | Recognition that outcomes depend on others, making collaboration both necessary and valuable. |

## Systemic Enablers (Pyramid Levels 2–3)

| Term | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Autonomy** | The ability to make decisions within agreed boundaries; freedom coupled with responsibility. |
| **Agency** | The individual or group’s capacity to act intentionally to influence outcomes within a system. |
| **Distribution of Roles** | How authority, accountability, and contribution are shared to balance autonomy and coherence. |
| **Feedback Loops** | Mechanisms through which information about performance or environment is used to adjust behavior and improve outcomes. |
| **Change / Uncertainty** | Natural variability in environment, priorities, or conditions that tests the adaptability of the system. |

## Cooperative Function Groups (Level 3)

| Term | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Strategic Alignment** | Ensures clarity of *what* and *why* — aligning purpose and understanding across participants. |
| **Execution & Coordination** | Maintains flow of work, role clarity, and cross-functional collaboration. |
| **Systemic Governance** | Establishes decision-making, delegation, and accountability mechanisms that balance trust and control. |
| **Learning & Adaptation** | Converts experience and feedback into collective improvement and resilience. |
| **Communication Fidelity** | Ensures that messages are transmitted, received, and interpreted as intended. |

## Principles and Rules

| Term | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Function-First Principle** | Effective practices must be matched to the cooperative function they serve, not adopted by imitation. |
| **Lowest-Level Fix Rule** | Interventions should always address the root level where instability originates. |
| **Whole-System View** | Understanding that all cooperative dimensions interact; improvement in one area affects others. |
| **Reflective Practice** | Periodic examination of how cooperation itself functions, leading to intentional redesign (Level 5 behavior). |

## Relationships to Other Frameworks

| Term | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **3-in-3 SDLC Framework (3SF)** | A meta-framework derived from HCS principles that operationalizes cooperation in software delivery ecosystems. |
| **Agile / Lean / Scrum** | Examples of Level 4 frameworks that depend on stable lower-level cooperative functions to succeed. |
| **Systems Thinking** | The philosophical foundation of HCS — viewing cooperation as an interconnected adaptive system rather than a set of isolated practices. |

## Extended Conditions and Needs

| Term | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Extended Conditions Types** | Contextual, relational, structural, developmental categories used to classify non-core influences. |
| **Extended Conditions** | Contextual, relational, structural, and developmental factors that influence how cooperation is experienced. They do not alter the Core Model but explain variation in quality, tension, or stability. |
| **Extended Needs Categories** | Purpose, trust/safety, growth, belonging/recognition, autonomy/coherence. |
| **Extended Needs** | Human motivational and relational needs (purpose, recognition, belonging, growth, autonomy) that affect engagement and emotional experience within cooperation. Not required for the Core Model to function but critical for sustained, humane collaboration. |
| **Collective Conditions / Needs** | System-level patterns, narratives, norms, or motivations that emerge from groups rather than individuals. They influence shared meaning, fairness, identity, and cohesion. |
| **Individual Conditions / Needs** | A person’s lived experience within cooperation — clarity, predictability, psychological safety, recognition, growth, autonomy, and emotional security. |
| **Distortion Vectors** | Forces that amplify or suppress conditions and needs, making cooperation difficult even when structure is intact. Represented as political or psychological influences. |
| **Quadrant** | The four-way classification used in Extended Human Dynamics: Collective Condition, Individual Condition, Collective Need, Individual Need. Guides correct intervention level and prevents misdiagnosis. |

## Influence Fields

| Term | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Political Vector** | The influence of power, legitimacy, resource control, representation, and informal hierarchies on cooperation. Political dynamics affect permission, visibility, and whose interests shape decisions. |
| **Psychological Vector** | The influence of emotions, identity, fear, uncertainty, trust posture, and personal narratives on cooperation. Psychological dynamics affect participation, safety, and interpretation of events. |
| **Intervention Level** | The correct systemic layer at which an issue must be addressed — structural, collective, relational, or individual. Prevents treating human issues as structural failures or vice versa. |

## Reference Purpose

This glossary ensures terminological clarity across all components of the Human Cooperation System and supports:

- Consistent interpretation of key terms in diagnostics and workshops.
- Alignment between HCS theory and practical applications such as 3SF.
- Educational use in training, coaching, and organizational learning contexts.
