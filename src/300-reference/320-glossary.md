# Glossary

The **Human Cooperation System (HCS)** defines a foundational language for describing the dynamics of **cooperative work systems** — how individuals and groups align, commit, and adapt together across levels of stability and change.<br/>
This glossary supports consistency across HCS Core Model, Pyramid, Matrix, and Diagnostic Workflow.

## Core System Terms

| Term | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Human Cooperation System (HCS)** | A diagnostic system that explains how cooperative work remains stable and adaptive across changing conditions. It models the “physics” of collaboration using the Pyramid, Matrix, and Level Rule. |
| **Pyramid Model** | Hierarchical structure of stability, from foundational human conditions (Level 1) to reflective meta-practices (Level 5). |
| **Matrix Model (5×5)** | Two-dimensional map crossing five cooperative dimensions with five human conditions to identify functional gaps or tensions in a system. |
| **Level Rule** | Governing principle stating that dysfunction at a lower level cannot be resolved by interventions at higher levels. Stability must be restored bottom-up. |
| **Diagnostic Workflow** | A repeatable method for observing behaviors, identifying affected levels and functions, and selecting interventions that respect the Level Rule. |

## Foundational Conditions (Pyramid Level 1)

| Term | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Common Purpose** | The shared intent that gives meaning and direction to collective effort. |
| **Shared Understanding** | The degree to which participants interpret information and goals in the same way. |
| **Mutual Commitment** | The willingness of each participant to invest effort and uphold agreements that sustain cooperation. |
| **Trust** | Confidence that others will act reliably and with integrity within shared norms. |
| **Interdependence** | Recognition that outcomes depend on others, making collaboration both necessary and valuable. |

## Systemic Enablers (Pyramid Levels 2–3)

| Term | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Autonomy** | The ability to make decisions within agreed boundaries; freedom coupled with responsibility. |
| **Agency** | The individual or group’s capacity to act intentionally to influence outcomes within a system. |
| **Distribution of Roles** | How authority, accountability, and contribution are shared to balance autonomy and coherence. |
| **Feedback Loops** | Mechanisms through which information about performance or environment is used to adjust behavior and improve outcomes. |
| **Change / Uncertainty** | Natural variability in environment, priorities, or conditions that tests the adaptability of the system. |

## Cooperative Function Groups (Level 3)

| Term | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Strategic Alignment** | Ensures clarity of *what* and *why* — aligning purpose and understanding across participants. |
| **Execution & Coordination** | Maintains flow of work, role clarity, and cross-functional collaboration. |
| **Systemic Governance** | Establishes decision-making, delegation, and accountability mechanisms that balance trust and control. |
| **Learning & Adaptation** | Converts experience and feedback into collective improvement and resilience. |
| **Communication Fidelity** | Ensures that messages are transmitted, received, and interpreted as intended. |

## Principles and Rules

| Term | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Function-First Principle** | Effective practices must be matched to the cooperative function they serve, not adopted by imitation. |
| **Lowest-Level Fix Rule** | Interventions should always address the root level where instability originates. |
| **Whole-System View** | Understanding that all cooperative dimensions interact; improvement in one area affects others. |
| **Reflective Practice** | Periodic examination of how cooperation itself functions, leading to intentional redesign (Level 5 behavior). |

## Relationships to Other Frameworks

| Term | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **3-in-3 SDLC Framework (3SF)** | A meta-framework derived from HCS principles that operationalizes cooperation in software delivery ecosystems. |
| **Agile / Lean / Scrum** | Examples of Level 4 frameworks that depend on stable lower-level cooperative functions to succeed. |
| **Systems Thinking** | The philosophical foundation of HCS — viewing cooperation as an interconnected adaptive system rather than a set of isolated practices. |

## Reference Purpose

This glossary ensures terminological clarity across all components of the Human Cooperation System and supports:

- Consistent interpretation of key terms in diagnostics and workshops.
- Alignment between HCS theory and practical applications such as 3SF.
- Educational use in training, coaching, and organizational learning contexts.
