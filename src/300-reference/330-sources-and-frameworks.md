# Sources and Frameworks

The **Human Cooperation System (HCS)** builds upon a wide range of theories, models, and disciplines that have shaped how humans understand **cooperation, trust, and adaptive systems**.<br/>
This section lists the **academic and conceptual influences** that inform HCS theory and its derivatives (including 3SF).

Each source is categorized by its **theoretical contribution area** — systemic, psychological, communicative, or organizational — highlighting how HCS integrates existing knowledge into a unified diagnostic model of human cooperation.

## Systems Thinking and Cybernetics

| Source / Framework | Core Idea | Relevance to HCS |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **General Systems Theory (Bertalanffy)** | All systems — biological, social, or technical — share structural and functional patterns. | Provides the foundation for viewing cooperation as a *system of interacting elements* rather than isolated behaviors. |
| **The Fifth Discipline (Peter Senge)** | Organizations learn and adapt through feedback and systemic awareness. | Inspires HCS’s focus on *feedback loops* and *collective learning* as stabilizing forces. |
| **The Viable System Model (Stafford Beer)** | Describes how systems maintain internal stability and external adaptability through recursive control loops. | Informs HCS’s concept of *Systemic Governance* and *Autonomy–Control balance*. |
| **Cybernetics (Wiener / Ashby)** | Studies self-regulating systems and the role of feedback and control. | Underpins HCS’s diagnostic logic and *Level Rule* — stability emerges from functional feedback, not hierarchy. |
| **Complex Adaptive Systems (Holland / Gell-Mann)** | Systems evolve through adaptation and local interaction under uncertainty. | Reinforces HCS’s treatment of *Change and Uncertainty* as natural, not exceptional, conditions. |

## Human Motivation and Organizational Psychology

| Source / Framework | Core Idea | Relevance to HCS |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hierarchy of Needs (Maslow)** | Human motivation progresses from basic to self-actualizing needs. | Provides conceptual ancestry for the *HCS Pyramid* and the *Level Rule* — higher forms of cooperation rely on lower-level stability. |
| **Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan)** | Autonomy, competence, and relatedness drive intrinsic motivation. | Directly informs HCS’s dimensions of *Autonomy* and *Mutual Commitment*. |
| **Theory X and Theory Y (McGregor)** | Management assumptions influence employee motivation and trust. | Supports HCS’s framing of *Trust* and *Agency* as emergent, not enforceable, conditions. |
| **Psychological Safety (Edmondson)** | Teams learn and innovate when members feel safe to take interpersonal risks. | Embedded in HCS’s *Learning and Adaptation* function. |
| **Social Exchange Theory (Blau)** | Relationships are sustained through reciprocal benefit and fairness. | Grounds HCS’s view of *Mutual Commitment* as both emotional and contractual. |
| **Self-Determination Theory / Modern Motivation Models** | Motivation emerges from autonomy, mastery, and belonging rather than external control. | Supports HCS Extended Needs around autonomy, growth, and recognition. |
| **SCARF Model (David Rock)** | Social threat and reward shape behavior through status, certainty, autonomy, relatedness, and fairness. | Provides psychological foundations for Extended Needs and psychological vectors. |
| **Intrinsic Motivation Models (Pink / Oldham / Hackman)** | Engagement increases when work is meaningful, self-directed, and feedback-rich. | Aligns with Extended Needs such as purpose, autonomy, and growth. |

## Communication and Shared Meaning

| Source / Framework | Core Idea | Relevance to HCS |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shannon–Weaver Model of Communication** | Information transmission depends on reducing noise and distortion. | Forms basis for HCS’s *Communication Fidelity* function. |
| **Double-Loop Learning (Argyris & Schön)** | True learning requires questioning underlying assumptions, not just correcting errors. | Informs *Reflective Practice* and *Level 5 Meta-Systems Thinking*. |
| **Sensemaking (Weick)** | People construct meaning retrospectively to understand ambiguous situations. | Explains why *Shared Understanding* is a dynamic, co-created process. |
| **Nonviolent Communication (Marshall Rosenberg)** | Needs-based, empathetic dialogue that improves relational clarity and trust. | Supports Core Trust (feedback clarity) and Extended Relational Conditions (emotional safety, conflict repair). |
| **Radical Candor (Kim Scott)** | Honest, caring communication strengthens accountability and relationships. | Informs relational repair within Extended Dynamics. |

## Organizational Design and Governance

| Source / Framework | Core Idea | Relevance to HCS |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sociotechnical Systems Theory (Trist & Emery)** | Optimal performance arises when social and technical subsystems are jointly optimized. | Validates HCS’s integration of human and procedural stability layers. |
| **Lean Thinking (Womack & Jones)** | Continuous removal of waste to improve flow and value. | Reflects in HCS’s *Execution & Coordination* function. |
| **Kaizen** | Continuous small improvements by all participants. | Embedded in *Learning & Adaptation* and the *Diagnostic Workflow*. |
| **Adaptive Leadership (Heifetz)** | Leadership is about enabling systems to adapt, not control. | Mirrors the *Systemic Governance* and *Agency* principles in HCS. |
| **Organizational Learning (Argyris, Senge)** | Organizations evolve when individuals learn within systemic feedback structures. | Reinforces *Systemic Learning* and the importance of *feedback closure*. |

## Power, Influence, and Organizational Politics

| Source / Framework | Core Idea | Relevance to HCS |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **French & Raven’s Bases of Power** | Power derives from position, expertise, relationships, information, and personal influence. | Forms the basis of HCS’s *political vector*, explaining how influence affects cooperation. |
| **Organizational Politics Research (Mintzberg / Pfeffer)** | Informal networks, hidden agendas, and resource negotiation shape real decision-making. | Validates HCS’s distinction between *formal structure* and *actual influence flows*. |
| **Stakeholder Theory (Freeman)** | Organizations must manage diverse interests and legitimacy claims. | Supports Collective Extended Needs around fairness, representation, and legitimacy. |

## Philosophical and Ethical Foundations

| Source / Framework | Core Idea | Relevance to HCS |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Aristotle – Nicomachean Ethics** | Virtue arises from practiced balance between extremes. | Influences HCS’s pursuit of equilibrium between autonomy and control. |
| **Kantian Ethics** | Human cooperation is grounded in respect for rational agency. | Echoes in HCS’s concept of *Agency* and moral interdependence. |
| **Ubuntu Philosophy (“I am because we are”)** | Human identity and well-being are inseparable from community. | Embodies the relational worldview behind *Interdependence* and *Mutual Commitment*. |
| **Phenomenology (Husserl / Merleau-Ponty)** | Meaning is constructed through lived experience. | Supports HCS’s principle that *Shared Understanding* emerges through interaction, not instruction. |

## Interpersonal Dynamics and Conflict

| Source / Framework | Core Idea | Relevance to HCS |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conflict Styles (Thomas–Kilmann)** | People favor competing, avoiding, accommodating, compromising, or collaborating under tension. | Helps interpret relational distortions in Extended Conditions. |
| **Attachment Theory (Bowlby / Ainsworth)** | Safety and past relational patterns influence trust and conflict behaviour. | Provides psychological grounding for individual Extended Needs (safety, belonging). |
| **Emotional Intelligence (Goleman)** | Self-awareness and empathy shape communication effectiveness. | Aligns with relational conditions and leader behavior in Extended Dynamics. |

## Bridging Toward Practice

| Source / Framework | Core Idea | Relevance to HCS |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Agile / Lean / Scrum** | Frameworks that operationalize adaptability and feedback. | Represent Level 4 practices that rely on stable lower-level HCS conditions. |
| **3-in-3 SDLC Framework (3SF)** | Systemic governance model for client–vendor ecosystems. | Serves as a *Level 5 derivative* — an applied embodiment of HCS principles. |
| **Team Topologies (Skelton & Pais)** | Structures teams for flow and cognitive load balance. | In practice, can be evaluated through HCS’s *Execution & Coordination* function. |
| **VMOSA / OKR / Wardley Maps** | Strategic planning and situational awareness frameworks. | Connect to *Strategic Alignment* at Level 3, translating cooperative intent into measurable direction. |
| **Situational Leadership (Hersey–Blanchard)** | Leadership behavior must match follower readiness and capability. | Supports Extended Needs around growth, autonomy, and developmental alignment. |
| **Liberating Structures** | Creates equal-opportunity participation environments. | Supports fairness, belonging, and balanced contribution in Extended Dynamics. |
| **RACI / Decision Records (ADR/CDR)** | Makes decisions, ownership, and roles explicit. | Reinforces Core Conditions: clarity, coordination, and boundary safety. |

## Reference Philosophy

HCS does not seek to **supersede** these theories — it **synthesizes** their enduring principles into a unified, practical system for diagnosing cooperation.

> **In essence:**<br/>
> **HCS = (Systems Thinking + Organizational Psychology) × (Communication + Adaptive Governance)**<br/>
> structured through the **Pyramid** (stability hierarchy) and **Matrix** (functional map),<br/>
> providing the theoretical foundation for applied frameworks like **3SF**.
