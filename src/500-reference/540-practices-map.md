# Practices Map

This chapter provides a **reference-level overview** of commonly used practices that support either:

- **Core Model functions** (Matrix + Pyramid Levels 1–3), or  
- **Extended Human Dynamics** (Extended Conditions and Extended Needs).

Practices are included only to illustrate **where teams often look for help** once they have:

1. Used the **Diagnostic Workflow** to locate a structural function or level, and  
2. Optionally applied **Diagnostic Dynamics** to understand political and psychological fields.

They are **optional**, **framework-neutral**, and **not prescriptive**.

Each practice is listed with:

- A brief **functional purpose** (what it helps with)  
- Its **HCS mapping** (Core / Extended / Mixed and, where helpful, key needs or conditions)  
- A simple **category** for navigation  

The intent is to offer **direction**, not detailed instruction or endorsement.

## Legend

**Core** – Primarily supports minimal structural conditions and needs of the HCS Core Model  
**Extended** – Primarily supports motivation, relational dynamics, psychological or political influences  
**Mixed** – Addresses both Core and Extended dynamics

Use this map **after** you know:

- which **Matrix cell / function** you are strengthening, and  
- which **System Mode** you are in (Setup, Stabilization, Growth, Conflict, Reset).

## How to Use This Map

These mappings describe **where practices are often helpful**, not what you *must* use.

When working with HCS:

1. **Start with structure**  
   - Use the **Diagnostic Workflow** to locate the issue in the Matrix and Pyramid.  
   - Identify the **lowest unstable level** and the Cooperative Function to strengthen.

2. **Layer human dynamics if needed**  
   - Use **Diagnostic Dynamics** to understand Extended Conditions, Extended Needs, and political/psychological fields.  
   - Determine whether the issue is primarily **structural**, **collective**, **relational**, or **individual**.

3. **Check your System Mode**  
   - In **Setup**, use practices that help clarify purpose, roles, and expectations.  
   - In **Stabilization**, focus on practices that make feedback and coordination safer and clearer.  
   - In **Growth**, use practices that extend autonomy, learning, and shared narrative without eroding safety.  
   - In **Conflict**, choose practices that support safe confrontation and repair.  
   - In **Reset**, use practices that help integrate learning and close or redesign cooperation with integrity.

4. **Select practices as hypotheses, not prescriptions**  
   - Use this map to suggest **candidate practices** for experimentation.  
   - Combine structural changes (roles, decisions, flows) with **targeted human practices** where appropriate.

5. **Avoid common misuses**  
   - Do not use interpersonal tools to **hide structural injustice** or broken agreements.  
   - Do not adopt practices “because others use them” without a clear **function-first** justification.  
   - Do not expect any practice to compensate for missing **Level 1–2** foundations (purpose, trust, basic safety).

The Practices Map is intentionally **lightweight**.  
Its purpose is to **orient** practitioners toward appropriate tools once the **systemic diagnosis is clear**,  
not to replace the design and governance decisions defined by HCS.
