### Version 2.0 Summary

Version 2.0 is the first fully consolidated release of HCS, integrating the Core Model, Extended Human Dynamics, System Modes, and Diagnostics into a single, unified cooperation system.  
While it preserves conceptual continuity with V1.0, it supersedes V1.0 as the primary reference.

Key additions and refinements:

- **Introducing System Modes as a new section**
  - Defines five **System Modes** — Setup, Stabilization, Growth, Conflict, Reset — as **system-level stances** that describe *what kind of work* is appropriate given the current state of cooperation.
  - Makes mode choice explicit so practitioners avoid:
    - trying to **grow** a system that still needs **stabilization**,  
    - using **conflict tools** where a **reset** is needed,  
    - or attempting a **setup** change when a **conflict** must be acknowledged first.
  - Connects modes directly to the Core Model and Extended Dynamics, so each mode has clear structural focus and human-dynamics implications.

- **Dedicated Diagnostics section**
  - **Diagnostic Workflow** – a structural loop from observation → Matrix mapping → Level check → Function → Practice → learning, grounded in the Core Model.
  - **Diagnostic Dynamics** – a complementary view that layers Extended Conditions, Extended Needs, and political/psychological fields onto the structural diagnosis, without changing the Core Model itself.
  - Diagnostics is framed as a **navigation pattern**, not a new theory layer.

- **Clear separation between theory and practice references**
  - Practice examples and tools are moved into a neutral **Practices Map** in the Reference section.
  - The Core Model remains explicitly **function-first** and framework-independent; practices are treated as optional examples, not prescriptions.

- **Positioning clarified**
  - HCS is described explicitly as a **cooperation operating system**:
    - a stable conceptual base for diagnosing and designing cooperative systems,
    - able to support multiple applied frameworks (such as 3SF),
    - without becoming a delivery methodology or team process framework on its own.

Overall, V2.0 unifies all HCS elements into a coherent operating system and supersedes V1.0 as the authoritative model.  
*(Version 1.0 remains available as historical context and early formulation of the Core Model.)*

### Version 1.0 Summary

Version 1.0 consolidates the **foundational architecture** of the Human Cooperation System across two complementary layers:

- **Core Model** — the structural foundation of cooperation, including the 5×5 Matrix, Pyramid, Level Rule, and Diagnostic Workflow.
- **Extended Human Dynamics** — classification of collective and individual conditions and needs, and the influence of psychological and political vectors on real-world cooperation.
- **Reference Practices Map** — a non-prescriptive orientation linking common leadership and communication practices to relevant HCS functions.
- **Reference Section** — Glossary and theoretical sources covering systemic, psychological, relational, and governance influences.

This release establishes HCS as a **complete V1.0 system**:  
a stable theoretical base (Core Model) and a complementary human-centered layer (Extended Dynamics), suitable for diagnostics, education, and derivative frameworks such as 3SF.

## Versioning Policy

- **Major versions (V2, V3, …)** introduce new theoretical constructs or expanded diagnostic models.
- **Minor revisions (e.g., V2.1)** include refinements, clarifications, or terminology alignment with derivative frameworks (e.g., 3SF).
- All published versions will remain **permanently available** for reference and citation.
- Future releases will aim to maintain **backward compatibility** with the foundational definitions, rules, and models of HCS.
