# Integration Guide

The **Core Model** defines the structural foundation of cooperation.  
**Extended Human Dynamics** describes the human and political forces that shape how cooperation is experienced.

This guide explains how to use both layers together in a coherent way, across all **System Modes**.

It is not a new model.  
It is a **navigation pattern** that keeps:

- the Core Model clean and universal, and  
- Extended Dynamics grounded in structure rather than personality or vague “culture”.

The goal is to make cooperation **understandable and actionable** without oversimplifying human systems.

## The Integration Principle

At the highest level:

- Use the **Core Model** to diagnose **structural gaps**.  
- Use **Extended Human Dynamics** to diagnose **human and political distortions**.

Both must be considered, but never confused.

If you treat a structural issue as a purely human one, you drift into blaming individuals for systemic design choices.  
If you treat a human or political issue as purely structural, you redesign processes while leaving the real tension untouched.

The Integration Principle keeps these dimensions **separate but connected**.

## What Each Layer Is Responsible For

### Core Model (Matrix + Pyramid)

Use the Core Model to reason about:

- **What cooperation requires** (conditions, needs, functions).  
- **How these requirements depend on each other** (levels and Level Rule).  
- **Where in the system** a breakdown is happening structurally.

Typical questions:

- Which **conditions** are missing or unstable (Common Purpose, Interdependence, Communication, Trust, Change/Uncertainty)?  
- Which **core needs** are not being met (Shared Understanding, Mutual Commitment, Feedback Loops, Distribution of Roles, Autonomy & Agency)?  
- Which **functions** from the Matrix are under strain (e.g., Problem Discovery, Coordination, Monitoring & Feedback)?  
- At which **level** does instability first appear (Preconditions, Needs, Functions, Practices, Meta-Practices)?

### Extended Human Dynamics (Conditions + Needs)

Use Extended Dynamics to reason about:

- **How cooperation is felt and interpreted** by individuals and groups.  
- **Which contextual, relational, structural, or developmental patterns** are amplifying or suppressing cooperation.  
- **Which deeper needs** (Purpose & Direction, Trust & Safety, Growth & Evolution, Recognition & Belonging, Autonomy & Coherence) are at play.

Typical questions:

- How do **collective conditions** (culture, incentives, decision norms) affect behavior?  
- How do **individual conditions** (perceived safety, control, predictability) shape engagement?  
- Which **extended needs** are most salient in this conflict or disengagement?  
- How are **political vectors** (power, visibility, gatekeeping) and **psychological vectors** (fear, shame, identity, pride) interacting with the structure?

## A Simple Integration Pattern

The Integration Guide describes a repeatable four-step pattern that can be used inside any **System Mode** (Setup, Stabilization, Growth, Conflict, Reset).

### Step 1 – Start From Observation, Not Theory

Begin with what is **actually happening**:

- repeated friction between specific roles or teams  
- confusion about priorities or success criteria  
- stalled decisions, escalating conflict, or quiet disengagement  
- a sense that “we’re working hard but not moving together”

Write down **concrete examples**, not just interpretations (“X said Y in meeting Z”, “Access ticket waited 14 days”, “Three people privately said they don’t trust the roadmap”).

### Step 2 – Map to the Core Model

Ask: *“If I ignore personalities for a moment, what is structurally happening?”*

Use the Matrix and Pyramid to identify:

- Which **conditions** might be weak or misaligned?  
- Which **core cooperative needs** are clearly unmet?  
- Which **functions** (Matrix cells) are failing or missing?  
- At what **level** does the instability appear first?

Examples:

- Misaligned expectations → likely failure in **Common Purpose × Shared Understanding** (Alignment on why).  
- Chronic rework across teams → likely problems in **Interdependence × Distribution of Roles** (Coordination).  
- Fear of raising issues → likely fragility in **Trust × Feedback Loops** (Safety in feedback).

At this step, stay with **structure**, not personal motives.

### Step 3 – Add the Extended Lens

Once you have a structural hypothesis, ask:

> “Given this structure, **why might people be behaving this way**?”

Use Extended Conditions and Extended Needs to explore:

- **Contextual** patterns: volatility, opaque decisions, shifting priorities.  
- **Relational** patterns: alliances, avoidance, blame, emotional load.  
- **Structural** patterns: gatekeepers, bottlenecks, invisible veto power.  
- **Developmental** patterns: lack of learning rhythm, repeated unclosed loops.

Then consider:

- Which **extended needs** are driving the strongest reactions?  
  - Purpose & Direction?  
  - Trust & Safety?  
  - Growth & Evolution?  
  - Recognition & Belonging?  
  - Autonomy & Coherence?

This step explains *why* specific structural points are “hot” for people.

### Step 4 – Choose the Right Intervention Channels

With both layers in view, choose **how** to intervene:

- **Structural interventions**  
  - Clarify purpose, boundaries, roles, decision paths.  
  - Adjust dependencies, interfaces, or information flow.  
  - Redesign practices or governance to better support key functions.

- **Collective agreements**  
  - Align expectations about behavior, feedback, and repair.  
  - Make implicit norms explicit and renegotiate where needed.  
  - Establish shared rules for escalation, conflict handling, or change.

- **Individual support**  
  - Coaching, mentoring, or guided reflection.  
  - Support for people carrying disproportionate load or risk.  
  - Space to process change, conflict, or identity shifts.

The key is **alignment**:

- Don’t use individual coaching to compensate for **structural injustice**.  
- Don’t redesign process to fix what is fundamentally a **trust or safety breakdown**.  
- Don’t treat political power plays as if they were only misunderstandings about process.

## Using Practices and Tools Safely

Extended Human Dynamics naturally invites leadership tools (e.g., DiSC, SCARF, Moving Motivators, feedback models, mediation techniques).

Use such tools to:

- generate insight and shared vocabulary  
- surface perceptions, fears, and expectations  
- create space for reflection and dialogue  
- support personal and collective awareness

Do **not** use them to:

- override or ignore structural problems identified in the Core Model  
- assign fixed identity labels or stereotypes  
- “fix” political issues solely through individual personality work  
- “fix” structural issues solely through emotional or motivational interventions

The system dictates which tools are appropriate.  
Tools do not dictate what the system is.

## How This Guide Fits Within HCS

The Integration Guide is **not** an additional model.  
It is a practical bridge that ensures:

- the **Core Model** stays clean and universal  
- Extended Dynamics do not dilute structural clarity  
- practitioners avoid misdiagnosis (blaming people for system design, or vice versa)  
- leadership and coaching tools are used intentionally, not by reflex  
- interventions land at the **correct systemic level** and channel

Within **System Modes**:

- Setup Mode uses this guide to ensure initial design considers both structure and human reality.  
- Stabilization Mode uses it to separate structural faults from emotional or political reactions.  
- Growth Mode uses it to scale autonomy and learning without eroding safety or coherence.  
- Conflict Mode uses it to name what hurts without losing sight of structural leverage points.  
- Reset Mode uses it to design a new system while honoring what people have lived through.

Used consistently, the Integration Guide aligns **human experience** with **structural design**, helping cooperation become both **stable and humane**, both **clear and adaptive**.
