# Integration Guide

The **Core Model** defines the structural foundation of cooperation.  
**Extended Human Dynamics** describes the human and political forces that shape how cooperation is experienced.  
**System Modes** define how we act on the system over time.

The Diagnostics section — starting with this Integration Guide — explains how to use these three parts of HCS **together** in a coherent way.

It is not a new model.  
It is a **navigation pattern** that keeps:

- the Core Model clean and universal, and  
- Extended Dynamics grounded in structure rather than personality or vague “culture”,  
- System Modes anchored in real observations rather than wishful thinking.

The goal is to make cooperation **understandable and actionable** without oversimplifying human systems.

## The Integration Principle

At the highest level:

- Use the **Core Model** to diagnose **structural gaps**.  
- Use **Extended Human Dynamics** to diagnose **human and political distortions**.  
- Use **System Modes** to choose **what kind of work** is appropriate right now.

All three must be considered, but never confused.

If you treat a structural issue as a purely human one, you drift into blaming individuals for systemic design choices.  
If you treat a human or political issue as purely structural, you redesign processes while leaving the real tension untouched.  
If you ignore mode, you try to **grow** when you should **stabilize**, or **stabilize** what should be **reset**.

The Integration Principle keeps these dimensions **separate but connected**.

## What Each Layer Is Responsible For

### Core Model (Matrix + Pyramid)

Use the Core Model to reason about:

- **What cooperation requires** (conditions, needs, functions).  
- **How these requirements depend on each other** (levels and Level Rule).  
- **Where in the system** a breakdown is happening structurally.

Typical questions:

- Which **conditions** are missing or unstable (Common Purpose, Interdependence, Communication, Trust, Change/Uncertainty)?  
- Which **core needs** are not being met (Shared Understanding, Mutual Commitment, Feedback Loops, Distribution of Roles, Autonomy & Agency)?  
- Which **functions** from the Matrix are under strain (e.g., Problem Discovery, Coordination, Monitoring & Feedback)?  
- At which **level** does instability first appear (Preconditions, Needs, Functions, Practices, Meta-Practices)?

### Extended Human Dynamics (Conditions + Needs)

Use Extended Dynamics to reason about:

- **How cooperation is felt and interpreted** by individuals and groups.  
- **Which contextual, relational, structural, or developmental patterns** are amplifying or suppressing cooperation.  
- **Which deeper needs** (Purpose & Direction, Trust & Safety, Growth & Evolution, Recognition & Belonging, Autonomy & Coherence) are at play.

Typical questions:

- How do **collective conditions** (culture, incentives, decision norms) affect behavior?  
- How do **individual conditions** (perceived safety, control, predictability) shape engagement?  
- Which **extended needs** are most salient in this conflict or disengagement?  
- How are **political vectors** (power, visibility, gatekeeping) and **psychological vectors** (fear, shame, identity, pride) interacting with the structure?

### System Modes (Setup, Stabilization, Growth, Conflict, Reset)

Use System Modes to decide:

- **What kind of work** is appropriate now (design, repair, optimization, conflict handling, reset).  
- **What to prioritize** and **what to postpone** at this moment.  
- **How far** you can safely go at each level of the Pyramid without breaking the Level Rule.

Typical questions:

- Are we **starting something** that needs a deliberate shape? (Setup)  
- Are we **trying to repair recurring issues** and restore reliability? (Stabilization)  
- Are we **extending autonomy and capability** on a stable base? (Growth)  
- Are we **facing tensions and mistrust** that must be addressed directly? (Conflict)  
- Has the **context or purpose changed so much** that the old system no longer makes sense? (Reset)

Modes do not tell you *what is true* about the system.  
They tell you *what kind of response* is appropriate once you understand what is true.

## A Simple Integration Pattern

The Integration Guide describes a repeatable four-step pattern.

You can apply it **within any System Mode**, but it is especially powerful in Stabilization, Conflict, and Reset.

### Step 1 – Start From Observation, Not Theory

Begin with what is **actually happening**:

- repeated friction between specific roles or teams  
- confusion about priorities or success criteria  
- stalled decisions, escalating conflict, or quiet disengagement  
- a sense that “we’re working hard but not moving together”

Write down **concrete examples**, not just interpretations:

- “X said Y in meeting Z.”  
- “Access ticket waited 14 days before anyone picked it up.”  
- “Three people privately said they don’t trust the roadmap.”

This is your **observable surface**.  
Diagnostics starts from **evidence**, not from favorite models.

### Step 2 – Map to the Core Model

Ask:

> “If I ignore personalities for a moment, what is structurally happening?”

Use the Matrix and Pyramid to identify:

- Which **conditions** might be weak or misaligned?  
- Which **core cooperative needs** are clearly unmet?  
- Which **functions** (Matrix cells) are failing or missing?  
- At what **level** does the instability appear first?

Examples:

- Misaligned expectations → likely failure in **Common Purpose × Shared Understanding** (Alignment on why).  
- Chronic rework across teams → likely problems in **Interdependence × Distribution of Roles** (Coordination).  
- Fear of raising issues → likely fragility in **Trust × Feedback Loops** (Safety in feedback).

At this step, stay with **structure**, not personal motives.

This is also where the **Level Rule** applies most strongly:  
stabilize lower levels before expecting higher-level practices or innovation to stick.

### Step 3 – Add the Extended Lens

Once you have a structural hypothesis, ask:

> “Given this structure, **why might people be behaving this way**?”

Use Extended Conditions and Extended Needs to explore:

- **Contextual** patterns: volatility, opaque decisions, shifting priorities.  
- **Relational** patterns: alliances, avoidance, blame, emotional load.  
- **Structural** patterns: gatekeepers, bottlenecks, invisible veto power.  
- **Developmental** patterns: lack of learning rhythm, repeated unclosed loops.

Then consider:

- Which **extended needs** are driving the strongest reactions?
  - Purpose & Direction?  
  - Trust & Safety?  
  - Growth & Evolution?  
  - Recognition & Belonging?  
  - Autonomy & Coherence?

This step explains *why* specific structural points are “hot” for people:

- why some functions meet resistance,  
- why some agreements feel unfair,  
- why some changes trigger disproportionate reactions.

The goal is **understanding**, not excuse-making:  
human dynamics do not override structural issues, they explain how those issues are lived.

### Step 4 – Choose the Right Mode and Intervention Channels

With both layers in view, decide:

1. **Which System Mode fits the current situation best?**

   - Are you mostly lacking a proper design? → **Setup Mode**  
   - Are you trying to restore basic reliability? → **Stabilization Mode**  
   - Are you trying to extend autonomy/capability on a stable base? → **Growth Mode**  
   - Are you dealing with strong tension, mistrust, or harm? → **Conflict Mode**  
   - Has the cooperation’s purpose or context fundamentally shifted? → **Reset Mode**

   You can change modes later as you learn more.  
   The point is to avoid mixing conflicting intentions (e.g., trying to Grow while you should Reset).

2. **Within that mode, choose appropriate intervention channels:**

   - **Structural interventions**
     - Clarify purpose, boundaries, roles, decision paths.  
     - Adjust dependencies, interfaces, or information flow.  
     - Redesign practices or governance to better support key functions.

   - **Collective agreements**
     - Align expectations about behavior, feedback, and repair.  
     - Make implicit norms explicit and renegotiate where needed.  
     - Establish shared rules for escalation, conflict handling, or change.

   - **Individual support**
     - Coaching, mentoring, or guided reflection.  
     - Support for people carrying disproportionate load or risk.  
     - Space to process change, conflict, or identity shifts.

The key is **alignment**:

- Don’t use individual coaching to compensate for **structural injustice**.  
- Don’t redesign process to fix what is fundamentally a **trust or safety breakdown**.  
- Don’t treat political power plays as if they were only misunderstandings about process.  
- Don’t choose a mode whose intent contradicts the system’s actual needs.

## Using Practices and Tools Safely

Extended Human Dynamics naturally invites leadership tools:

- personality / style lenses (e.g., DiSC),  
- social neuroscience models (e.g., SCARF),  
- motivation and needs tools (e.g., Moving Motivators),  
- feedback and mediation techniques.

Use such tools to:

- generate insight and shared vocabulary,  
- surface perceptions, fears, and expectations,  
- create space for reflection and dialogue,  
- support personal and collective awareness.

Do **not** use them to:

- override or ignore structural problems identified in the Core Model,  
- assign fixed identity labels or stereotypes,  
- “fix” political issues solely through individual personality work,  
- “fix” structural issues solely through emotional or motivational interventions.

The system dictates which tools are appropriate.  
Tools do not dictate what the system is.

## How This Guide Fits Within HCS

The Integration Guide is **not** an additional model.  
It is a practical bridge that ensures:

- the **Core Model** stays clean and universal,  
- Extended Dynamics do not dilute structural clarity,  
- System Modes are chosen consciously, not implicitly,  
- practitioners avoid misdiagnosis (blaming people for system design, or vice versa),  
- leadership and coaching tools are used intentionally, not by reflex,  
- interventions land at the **correct systemic level** and through the right channels.

Within **System Modes**:

- **Setup Mode** uses this guide to ensure initial design considers both structure and human reality.  
- **Stabilization Mode** uses it to separate structural faults from emotional or political reactions.  
- **Growth Mode** uses it to scale autonomy and learning without eroding safety or coherence.  
- **Conflict Mode** uses it to name what hurts without losing sight of structural leverage points.  
- **Reset Mode** uses it to design a new system (or end the old one) while honoring what people have lived through.

Subsequent files in the Diagnostics section build on this guide:

- **Diagnostic Workflow** – a step-by-step walk through the Matrix and Pyramid to locate structural instability.  
- **Diagnostic Dynamics** – ways to layer Extended Conditions and Extended Needs onto that workflow.

Used consistently, the Integration Guide aligns **human experience** with **structural design** and **mode choice**,  
helping cooperation become both **stable and humane**, both **clear and adaptive**.
