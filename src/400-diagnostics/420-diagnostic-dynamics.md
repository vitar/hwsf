# Diagnostic Dynamics – Working With Political and Psychological Fields

The **Diagnostic Workflow** focuses first on the **Core Model**:

- Conditions × Needs → Functions (Matrix)  
- Levels 1–5 (Pyramid)  
- Level Rule (stabilize lower levels first)

Often, that is enough to locate where cooperation is structurally unstable.

However, there are many situations where:

- structure looks correct **on paper**,  
- practices are in place,  
- but cooperation still feels tense, fragile, or distorted.

This is where **Diagnostic Dynamics** comes in.

It adds the lens of **Extended Human Dynamics** to diagnosis, by making visible:

- how **political fields** (power, legitimacy, visibility, gatekeeping) and  
- how **psychological fields** (fear, identity, fairness, safety)

are shaping **conditions and needs**, and therefore **behavior**, inside an otherwise sound structure.

Diagnostic Dynamics does **not** change the Core Model or the Level Rule.  
It helps you understand **why the system behaves the way it does**, so that interventions land at the right level.

## Political and Psychological Fields

The Core Model defines **what cooperation requires**.  
Extended Human Dynamics describes **what cooperation feels like**.

Political and psychological fields explain **why cooperation becomes difficult**, even when the basic design is in place.

### Political Field

Political influences emerge from:

- Power and authority distribution  
- Control of resources and access  
- Legitimacy battles (“who is the real owner?”)  
- Visibility and reputation  
- Representation and agenda-setting  
- Hidden coalitions, veto points, and gatekeepers

They shape:

- whose interests define reality when there is ambiguity,  
- whose work is prioritized or ignored,  
- who can say “no” without consequences.

**In short: political fields shape *permission*.**

### Psychological Field

Psychological influences emerge from:

- Fear, anxiety, loss of safety  
- Identity and status threat  
- Emotional triggers and personal history  
- Perceived fairness or unfairness  
- Trust posture (default trust or default suspicion)  
- Vulnerability and self-protection patterns

They shape:

- how people interpret behavior and decisions,  
- whether they speak up or stay silent,  
- whether they invest energy or withdraw.

**In short: psychological fields shape *participation*.**

Together, these fields can **distort** or **amplify** any condition or need:

- Cooperation can be structurally sound but **politically impossible**.  
- Cooperation can be well-designed but **psychologically unsafe**.

Diagnostic Dynamics makes these forces discussable without turning HCS into a personality or politics model.

## How Fields Act on Extended Conditions and Needs

Extended Human Dynamics describes:

- **Extended Conditions** – contextual, relational, structural, developmental patterns that shape the “climate” of cooperation.  
- **Extended Needs** – deeper human needs that show up around purpose, safety, growth, belonging, and autonomy.

Political and psychological fields can act on *any* of these.

Examples:

- **Contextual + Political**  
  - Strategy and priorities are defined by a small group; others feel decisions are opaque.  
  - Formally, purpose is clear; in practice, **whose purpose counts** is contested.

- **Relational + Psychological**  
  - Past incidents (broken promises, public shaming) make people cautious.  
  - Structurally, feedback channels exist; psychologically, feedback feels dangerous.

- **Structural + Political**  
  - A team owns a critical platform but has no formal say in roadmap decisions.  
  - On paper, roles and dependencies are defined; politically, they are ignored.

- **Developmental + Psychological**  
  - Repeated “failed initiatives” create learned helplessness.  
  - People no longer believe change efforts will last, even if design looks better.

These forces do not nullify the Core Model.  
They change **how conditions and needs are lived**, which in turn affects whether functions can operate as designed.

## Four Diagnostic Quadrants

To keep diagnosis precise, it helps to distinguish **where** the issue is most visible.

Think in terms of two axes:

1. **Condition vs Need** – Is this mostly about the **situation** we are in (conditions) or about **what people require** to stay engaged (needs)?  
2. **Collective vs Individual** – Is the pattern mostly **system-wide** or is it concentrated in **specific people or roles**?

This gives four quadrants:

1. **Collective Condition**  
   - Examples: overall culture of risk avoidance; cross-team blame habits; chronic overload.  
   - Often expressed as “this is how things are *around here*”.

2. **Individual Condition**  
   - Examples: one person has low perceived safety; another is isolated from key information; one role is structurally exposed.  
   - Often expressed as “this role / person is always in a difficult spot”.

3. **Collective Need**  
   - Examples: a department needs recognition; a partner needs legitimacy; a group needs real involvement in decisions.  
   - Often expressed as “they never listen to us” or “we’re treated as second-class”.

4. **Individual Need**  
   - Examples: a leader needs more clarity to lead; an engineer needs growth opportunities; someone needs assurance they will not be punished for honesty.  
   - Often expressed in 1:1s as “for me personally, this is what hurts”.

**Why this matters:**  
If you misidentify the quadrant, you will likely intervene at the wrong level:

- giving coaching to an individual when a whole group is structurally excluded,  
- changing process when a specific person needs support and feedback,  
- running a team workshop for what is fundamentally a cross-organization political conflict.

Quadrants help you be **precise about where the issue lives**.

## Three-Layer Diagnostic Sequence

When Extended Dynamics are clearly in play, use this sequence after the basic Diagnostic Workflow:

1. **Confirm the structural baseline (Core Model)**  
2. **Locate the quadrant (Extended Conditions/Needs)**  
3. **Select the intervention layer**

### Step 1. Confirm the Structural Baseline

First, use the **Diagnostic Workflow**:

- map the observation to the Matrix (Condition × Need → Function),  
- identify the lowest unstable level in the Pyramid,  
- form a hypothesis about the **structural** issue.

Ask:

- Is there a real design problem here (unclear purpose, missing roles, broken feedback)?  
- Or is the structure *technically* present but not used as intended?

Only once this is clear should you lean into Extended Dynamics.

### Step 2. Locate the Quadrant

Ask:

- Where is this most visible right now?

Examples:

- “People across multiple teams are afraid to speak up in large forums.”  
  → likely **Collective Condition** (fearful climate) + **Collective Need** (Trust & Safety).

- “One team feels consistently sidelined from key decisions.”  
  → likely **Collective Need** for Recognition & Belonging, with a **Structural** condition pattern.

- “A single senior engineer resists all changes and dominates discussions.”  
  → could be **Individual Condition** (identity threat) and **Individual Need** (Autonomy & Coherence),  
    but check whether they are carrying **systemic risk** that nobody else is owning.

Naming the quadrant prevents you from treating **systemic** issues as **personal** or vice versa.

### Step 3. Select the Intervention Layer

Once the quadrant is clear, choose the appropriate **intervention layer**:

- **Structural**
  - Adjust boundaries, roles, decision paths.  
  - Add or repair feedback loops, transparency, access.  
  - Example: change who approves work, who is at which meeting, or how information flows.

- **Collective**
  - Align purpose and narratives.  
  - Establish or renegotiate shared agreements.  
  - Run inclusion or representation checks (“who is affected vs who is in the room?”).  
  - Example: joint sessions between client and vendor leadership to reset expectations.

- **Relational**
  - Facilitate repair between specific roles or groups.  
  - Make reciprocity and respect explicit topics.  
  - Example: structured dialogue between two teams with history of mutual blame.

- **Individual**
  - Coaching, mentoring, tailored support.  
  - Help individuals process change, conflict, or identity shifts.  
  - Example: supporting a key person who is over-exposed to risk or conflict.

Often you will need a **combination** (e.g., structural + collective + relational).  
The point is to be intentional about **where you start**.

## Mode-Specific Signals

Diagnostic Dynamics plays differently depending on **System Mode**.

### In Setup Mode

Signals:

- Stakeholders hesitate to commit, even when design seems clear.  
- Some groups are “quiet” in early conversations; their risks or needs are not voiced.

Focus:

- Extended Conditions: who holds power, who feels vulnerable, who is missing.  
- Extended Needs: Purpose & Direction, Trust & Safety, Recognition & Belonging.

Intention:

- Use Extended Dynamics to design a **realistic starting shape**,  
  not an idealized cooperation contract that ignores politics and psychology.

### In Stabilization Mode

Signals:

- Same structural fixes are proposed repeatedly but never land.  
- People comply in meetings but revert to old patterns in practice.  
- Escalations are emotional, not only technical.

Focus:

- Extended Conditions: relational history, hidden gatekeepers, over-exposed roles.  
- Extended Needs: Trust & Safety, Autonomy & Coherence.

Intention:

- Distinguish between “we don’t know what to do” and “we don’t believe it’s safe or fair to do it”.  
- Adjust interventions accordingly: structural where needed, but also relational and individual.

### In Growth Mode

Signals:

- Some teams welcome increased autonomy; others show quiet resistance.  
- Perceived winners and losers emerge as scope expands.  
- Improvement initiatives are seen as “their agenda”, not “our evolution”.

Focus:

- Extended Needs: Growth & Evolution, Recognition & Belonging, Autonomy & Coherence.  
- Extended Conditions: structural and contextual fairness of growth.

Intention:

- Ensure growth does not erode safety or legitimacy.  
- Adjust growth pace and scope to what the system can integrate.

### In Conflict Mode

Signals:

- Strong narratives about “them” vs “us”.  
- Emotional reactions disproportionate to the immediate trigger.  
- People reinterpret events through a lens of past harm.

Focus:

- Both fields at full strength: political (who benefits, who suffers) and psychological (hurt, fear, shame).  
- Extended Needs: Trust & Safety, Recognition & Belonging, Purpose & Direction.

Intention:

- Make conflict **sayable** without punishment.  
- Separate structural, relational, and individual elements.  
- Decide honestly whether repair, containment, or Reset is appropriate.

### In Reset Mode

Signals:

- Cynicism and resignation, even when new proposals are sound.  
- People privately say “this should have ended a while ago”.  
- Old harms are carried into new conversations.

Focus:

- Extended Conditions: developmental history, accumulated fatigue.  
- Extended Needs: Purpose & Direction, Recognition & Belonging, Autonomy & Coherence.

Intention:

- Close or transform the system with **integrity**.  
- Ensure any new Setup does not inherit unspoken trauma or political debt.

## Practical Heuristics

A few quick rules of thumb:

- **“If structure is clear but behavior is erratic, check psychological fields.”**  
  Fear, identity threat, or learned helplessness often override clarity.

- **“If individuals keep failing in the same way, check collective conditions.”**  
  People adapt to the system they are in; repeated patterns are rarely purely personal.

- **“If the story makes sense to leadership but not to the team, check political fields.”**  
  Narratives often serve those who shape them.

- **“If conflict repeats, examine unmet needs, not personalities.”**  
  Unmet needs create stable patterns of resistance or withdrawal.

- **“If people stop speaking up, treat this as a system alarm, not a personal flaw.”**  
  Silence is both a political and a psychological signal.

These heuristics keep you from defaulting to the most comfortable explanation.

## How to Use Diagnostic Dynamics with the Workflow

In practice, combine the pieces like this:

1. **Run the Diagnostic Workflow**
   - Observation → Matrix → Level → Function → Practice.

2. **If friction persists or feels “hot”**, layer in Diagnostic Dynamics:
   - Identify quadrant (collective / individual × condition / need).  
   - Notice political and psychological fields at play.

3. **Pick a System Mode** that matches the overall situation:
   - Setup, Stabilization, Growth, Conflict, or Reset.

4. **Choose intervention layers** (structural, collective, relational, individual) that match:
   - the quadrant,  
   - the fields,  
   - and the mode.

5. **Run a small, explicit experiment**, then review:
   - Did structural changes help?  
   - Did relational work shift anything?  
   - Are different needs now visible?

Diagnostic Dynamics does not turn you into a therapist or a political strategist.  
It gives you enough language to:

- **see** how political and psychological fields shape cooperation,  
- **name** their effects without blaming individuals,  
- and **act** at the right level, with the right expectations.

That is often enough to turn “this is just how it is here” into something once again **changeable**.
